We'll all read your writing and each suggest what we like, keeping the good parts and cutting out the bad, and that should work.\" Jia Zheng said, \"You're right.

She laughed, \"The things you wear, must have been taken by those shameless people.\" Upon hearing this, Daiyu came over and saw that there was nothing left, and she scolded, \"Have you given my pouch to them as well? Don't expect me to give you anything anymore!\" She then stormed back to her room, picked up the sachet she had been working on the day before, and cut it into pieces with scissors. Upon seeing this, the young master hurried over and found that the sachet had already been cut. The young master had seen this sachet before, even though it was unfinished, it was very delicate, and it was very frustrating to cut it up without reason. So, the young master quickly unbuttoned his shirt and took off the pouch that was tied to his chest, and handed it to Daiyu. \"Look at this, what is this? I have never given you any of my things to others.\"",
