A few days later, the pain subsided but the scars remained, and he had to stay home to feel ashamed of his friends and relatives.

One of them, Zhang Dihui, had been working as a manager in Xue Pan's pawnshop since he was young, with an annual income of several thousand silver dollars. This year, he was also returning home, and wouldn't be back until next year. He said, \"This year, paper and incense are in short supply, and next year's prices will definitely be higher. Next year, I'll send my son to manage the pawnshop, and I'll take the opportunity to bring some paper and incense on my way back home. After deducting customs fees and other expenses, maybe I can make several times the interest.\"",
