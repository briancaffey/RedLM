            "chinese": "这梨香院是当年荣公晚年养息的地方，小而精致，大约有十几间房屋，前厅后舍都齐全。还有一扇门通往街面，薛蟠的家人就走这条路进出。西南有一扇角门，通一条夹道，出了夹道就是王夫人的正房东院了。每天午饭后或晚上，薛姨妈就过来，有时和贾母闲聊，有时和王夫人叙叙旧。宝钗每天和黛玉、迎春等姊妹们一起，或看书下棋，或做针线活，倒也相处得十分融洽。只是薛蟠起初不想住在这里，担心姨父管束得不自由；无奈母亲执意要住在这里，而且贾宅中又非常殷勤地挽留，只得暂时住下，一面派人打扫出自家的房屋，再搬过去。谁知来了不到一个月，贾宅族中的子侄就有一半和他认识了，那些纨绔子弟，没有不喜与他来往的。今天喝酒，明天看花，甚至聚赌嫖娼，什么坏事都干了，引诱得薛蟠比以前更坏了十倍。贾政管教儿子有方，治家有法。但是族人太多，照顾不到。贾珍现在是宁府长孙，袭职，族中的事情都是他掌管。公私事务很多，贾政素来潇洒，不以俗务为重。他空闲时喜欢看书和下棋。况且梨香院与贾政的住处相隔两层房舍，有街门可以进出，所以这些子弟可以放意畅怀地闹。因此，薛蟠不再打算搬出去住了。"

The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.  and the situation: A scientist is studying the environmental impact of energy production.
