Xingfu didn't know that Grandma Jiang had already known about the affair with Yanyang, so she thought Grandma Jiang was still asking about the news. When she went into the courtyard, several servants whispered to her that she knew. She wanted to go back, but she had already known, and when she saw Wang Fu welcoming her, she had to come in, and first knelt down to pay her respects to Grandma Jiang. Jiang didn't say a word. Xingfu also felt ashamed. Fengzhi had already pointed out an incident to avoid it. Yanyang also returned to her room to brood. Xueyima, Wangfu and others were afraid to hurt Xingfu's face, so they gradually withdrew. Xingfu was afraid to go out. Jiang saw no one, and said, \"I heard you came to talk to your husband about marriage? You are also a 'three from four' person, but this is too much. Now your grandchildren are in your eyes, and you still fear your husband's temper? I heard you encouraged your husband's temper.\" Xingfu's face turned red and said, \"II'm sorry, but I have to do it.\"\n\n基于以上翻译，生成一段流利的英文文本。\n\nWell, I understand where you're coming from.
