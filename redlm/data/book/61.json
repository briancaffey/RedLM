The boy took some things without them noticing. These two brats were scared and ran away. Now that the boy knows the truth, he's telling me slowly, showing me the things he took. They're all there. The snow mushroom was also something he got outside and shared with many people. Ai Xian gave some to Fangfang and others. They often got together. The two baskets of snow mushrooms were still on the table in the meeting room, unopened, but they're just making up lies? I'll tell the master about this.\" She then went back into the bedroom and told the master all this according to what she had just said.",
            "chinese": "平儿听了，才想起来，笑道：“哦！原来是他啊！我就明白了。”又笑道：“太着急了吧？现在这件事真相大白了。连前几天太太房里丢失的，也有主了。那天宝玉过来，和这两个孽障要什么东西，他们故意为难他，说：‘太太不在家，不敢拿。’宝玉趁他们不注意，自己进去拿了些东西出来。这两个孽障不知道，就吓慌了。现在宝玉知道了这件事，才慢慢告诉我，拿出东西让我看，一件不少。那茯苓霜也是宝玉在外面得来的，也赏给过很多人。袭人也给过芳官等人。他们私下交往，也是常事。前日那两篓还摆在议事厅上，好好的原封没动，怎么就胡乱赖人？等我回奶奶再说。“说完，转身进了卧室，把这件事按照前面的话告诉了凤姐儿一遍。"

Even if others ask him to help, he can't resist a few good words, and he will give them a charcoal basket and do anything. We believe in him, and if there is a big thing in the future, we will also do so. How can we govern people? We should be careful to investigate. In my opinion, we should take all the maids in Lady's room, although it is not convenient to beat them, but let them kneel on the magnetic tiles in the sun, without giving them food and drink, and one day is not said for one day, even if it is iron, it will also kneel for one day, and they will confess. The saying goes, 'The fly does not bite the egg without a crack.' Although Liu Jia did not steal, there are some doubts, and people will say so. Although we should not punish him with a thief, we should still dismiss him. The court has made a mistake from time to time, but it will not be considered unfair to him.\" Ping'er said, \"Why bother? 'It isFurthermore, I have experienced many disasters myself, and I finally became pregnant with a boy, but it miscarried at six or seven months. Isn't it because I have been overworked and angry for so long that I hurt myself? Now, if I see half of the person and not the other half, it's better.",
