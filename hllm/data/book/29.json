It's not appropriate to argue with Lin Daiyu.\" When Lin Daiyu heard this, despite her illness, she rushed over to take the穗子 and grabbed a pair of scissors, cutting it off. Zijuan and Xisi tried to stop her, but they could only watch as she cut several segments. Lin Daiyu cried, \"It's all for nothing. He doesn't care, and someone else will replace him with a new one.\" Xisi quickly took the jade away and said, \"Why do you have to do this? I was just being silly.\" Jade turned to Lin Daiyu and said, \"Cut it as much as you want! I'm not going to wear it anyway, and it doesn't matter.\"",
