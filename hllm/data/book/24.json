I'm not the only one. Normally, I don't deliver tea or water, fetch things, or attend to the minutiae of daily life, so I never had an opportunity to make myself known to you.\" Bao Yu asked, \"Why don't you do these daily tasks?\" The maid said, \"That's hard to explain. - However, I want to say that yesterday, there was a Yun who came to see you. I saw that you were busy, so I sent Beam back to turn him away. He came again today, and I never expected that you would have left for the North Mansion.\"",
