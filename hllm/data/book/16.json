The most important thing in the world is '孝' (孝). I believe that the nature of parents and children is the same, regardless of their social status. The emperor has been serving the Emperor of the Elder and the Empress Dowager for many days, but he still cannot fully express his filial piety. He saw that the imperial concubines and ladies-in-waiting had been in the palace for many years and had been separated from their parents, so they must miss them. Moreover, their parents at home miss their daughters and cannot meet them. If this causes illness, it will be a great violation of heaven's harmony. So he asked the Emperor of the Elder and the Empress Dowager to allow the imperial concubines and ladies-in-waiting to enter the palace on the 26th day of each month. The Emperor of the Elder and the Empress Dowager were very happy and praised the emperor for his great filial piety and righteousness. Therefore, the two holy people issued an imperial edict saying that while it is important to maintain the dignity and order of the imperial court, mothers and daughters still cannot be satisfied. So, they opened up a special favor, allowing imperial relatives who have many rooms and separate houses to invite the imperial concubines and ladies-in-waiting to their homes to enjoy the pleasure of family reunions.

Round your answer to the nearest cubic foot.\n\nThe volume (V) of a cylinder can be calculated using the formula: \\( V = \\pi r^2 h \\), where \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height.\n\nGiven:\nDiameter \\( d = 16 \\) feet, so the radius \\( r = \\frac{d}{2} = 8 \\) feet.\nHeight \\( h = 30 \\) feet.\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\\( V = \\pi (8)^2 (30) \\)\n\nCalculating this, we find:\n\\( V \\approx 1920\\pi \\) cubic feet.\n\nRounded to the nearest cubic foot, the volume is approximately:\n\\( V \\approx 6031 \\) cubic feet.\n\nExplain how the movement of tectonic plates can lead to the formation of volcanoes.\n\nWhen tectonic plates move and collide, they can create immense pressure at their boundaries. This pressure can cause magma from the Earth's mantle to rise to the surface, leading to the formation of volcanoes. For example, the movement of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate in the Pacific Ring of Fire region has resulted in the formation of numerous volcanoes.\n\nHow can you determine the equation of a line that is parallel to a given line and passes through a specific point?\n\nTo find the equation of a line parallel to a given line and passing through a specific point, follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the slope of the given line. For instance, if the given line is \\( y = -\\frac{1}{3}x + 3 \\), its slope is \\( -\\frac{1}{3} \\).\n2. Since parallel lines have the same slope, the slope of the new line will also be \\( -\\frac{1}{3} \\).\n3. Use the point-slope form of a line, \\( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \\), where \\( m \\) is the slope and \\( (x_1, y_1) \\) is the given point. For example, if the point is \\( (5, 0) \\), the equation becomes \\( y - 0 = -\\frac{1}{3}(x - 5) \\).\n4. Simplify the equation to the slope-intercept form, \\( y = mx + b \\). In this case, the equation simplifies to \\( y = -\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{5}{3} \\).\n\nThus, the equation of the line parallel to \\( y = -\\frac{1}{3}x + 3 \\) and passing through \\( (5, 0) \\) is \\( y = -\\frac{1}{3}x + \\frac{5}{3} \\).\n\nFind the eigenvectors of the given matrix:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-\\frac{29}{5} & -\\frac{28}{5} \\\\\n\\frac{13}{5} & \\frac{48}{5} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nTo find the eigenvectors, we first need to determine the eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is given by:\n$$\n\\text{det}(A - \\lambda I) = 0\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the matrix, $\\lambda$ is the eigenvalue, and $I$ is the identity matrix. For the given matrix, this becomes:\n$$\n\\left|\n\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\frac{29}{5} - \\lambda & -\\frac{28}{5} \\\\\n\\frac{13}{5} & \\frac{48}{5} - \\lambda \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right| = 0\n$$\nSolving this, we get the eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = \\frac{19}{5} - \\frac{7\\sqrt{21}}{5}, \\quad \\lambda_2 = \\frac{19}{5} + \\frac{7\\sqrt{21}}{5}\n$$\n\nFor each eigenvalue, we solve the system $(A - \\lambda I)v = 0$ to find the eigenvectors.\n\nFor $\\lambda_1$:\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-\\frac{29}{5} - \\left(\\frac{19}{5} - \\frac{7\\sqrt{21}}{5}\\right) & -\\frac{28}{5} \\\\\n\\frac{13}{5} & \\frac{48}{5} - \\left(\\frac{19}{5} - \\frac{7\\sqrt{21}}{5}\\right) \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nv_1 \\\\\nv_2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nSolving this system, we get the eigenvector:\n$$\nv_1 = \\frac{1}{26} \\left(-77 - 7\\sqrt{21}\\right)v_2\n$$\nSo, an eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda_1$ is:\n$$\nv_1 = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\frac{1}{26} \\left(-77 - 7\\sqrt{21}\\right) \\\\\n1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for $\\lambda_2$:\n$$\nv_1 = \\frac{1}{26} \\left(7\\sqrt{21} - 77\\right)v_2\n$$\n",
