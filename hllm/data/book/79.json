Here it is again, revised for clarity:\n\n\"You said that you had just finished your sacrifice for Qiongwen, and then suddenly heard a voice from the flower shade. You were startled. Upon careful inspection, it was not someone else, but it was Daiyu, who was smiling and said, 'How novel your eulogy is! It can be passed down along with The碑 of Cao E.' You blushed and answered, 'I thought that the usual eulogies were too common, so I changed the format. It was just a game for me, but you heard it. What's wrong with that? Why don't you change it?' Daiyu said, 'Where is the original draft? I want to read it carefully. It's a long essay, and I don't know what it's about. I only heard the middle two lines, 'In the red silk bed, the son is deeply in love; in the yellow soil mound, the daughter's fate is thin.' The meaning of this line is good. However, 'red silk bed' is a bit common. Why don't you use 'Cinnabar Window, the son is in love'? We now use cinnabar silk to cover our windows. Why not say 'Cinnabar Window, the son is in love'?\"\"\n\n宝玉忙问:\"What is a real true thing?\"\n\n黛玉笑道:\"We now have windows made of cinnabar silk, so why don't you say 'Cinnabar Window, the son is in love'?\"\n\n宝玉急忙回答道:\"好!好!真是好!我怎么没想到呢!我马上改。\"\n\n黛玉笑道:\"好!好!好!就用这个吧!\"\n\n宝玉和黛玉都非常高兴，然后他们就离开了那里。\n\n这段文字是一段生动的描述，通过生动的语言和细节，呈现了宝玉和黛玉之间的互动和情感交流。宝玉的祭文被黛玉赞美，但同时也受到了黛玉的批评和建议。宝玉最终采纳了黛玉的建议，并且表现出对黛玉的欣赏和感激。这段文字展示了宝玉和黛玉之间的友谊和互相尊重，也反映了他们在文学和艺术上的共同爱好。",

He couldn't sleep well at night, and was very restless. The next day, he didn't feel like eating or drinking, and felt hot all over his body. This was because of the recent inspections of the Big View Garden, the expulsion of Si Qi, the separation from Yingchun, and the humiliation of Qiongwen. It also caused him to be embarrassed, frightened, sad, and depressed. He also caught a cold from the wind and cold. He became ill and couldn't get up. Grandma Jia heard about this and came to visit him every day. Lady Wang felt sorry and didn't blame Si Qi too much. But on the outside, she didn't show it. She only asked the nurses to take good care of him. She asked the doctor to come twice a day to check his pulse and give him medicine. After a month, he slowly got better. For a hundred days, he was not allowed to eat meat or oily food, or go out. During this time, the garden was not allowed to go to, and he could only stay in the room. After a few months, he got bored and couldn't stand it. He tried to think of ways to do things, but his grandparents and Lady Wang didn't let him. So, he played jokes with his servants and did all kinds of things he wanted to do. After a few months, he felt better and was allowed to go outside.In a short while, Xue Pan held a feast at home and sang and danced, making it very lively. He had already married. Hearing that Xue Pan's bride was very beautiful and had good literary knowledge, Yu Boyang thought it would be great if he could meet her. After some time, he heard that Yingsun had married as well. Reflecting on the past, Yu Boyang felt sad that he would not be able to see his sisters as closely as before, even if they were to meet again in the future. As he could not visit them, he had to bear the pain. Therefore, he spent his time with the maids, playing and having fun, to avoid being scolded by Jia Zheng and forced to study. During these 100 days, Yu Boyang lived in the Red Plum Garden and was unbridled with the maids, doing things that were rarely seen in the world. For now, we will not talk about these things.",

            "english": "Translated to English:\n\nWhen the golden chrysanthemum saw her husband's flagging momentum, and her mother-in-law's goodness, she slowly began to wield her sword and ride her horse. Initially, she merely bullied Xue Pan, but later she became more seductive and even started to bother Xue Mima and Xue Baochai. Xue Baochai had long been aware of the unscrupulous intentions of the golden chrysanthemum and cleverly deflected her advances with her words. The golden chrysanthemum realized that she could not prevail and tried to find a way to provoke her, but she could not find any opportunity. In the end, she had to humbly submit to her.\n\nThese words are from the famous Chinese novel, Dream of the Red Chamber, written by Cao Xueqin. The passage describes the character of Jia Baoyu's wife, Xue Baochai's cousin, Xue Gai, who initially seems to be a gentle and quiet woman, but her true nature is gradually revealed. Her attempts to exert her influence on her in-laws and her cousin are met with resistance, particularly from Xue Baochai, who is able to effectively counter her.",
