After the doctor was called and the medicine was prepared by Autumn Silk, she lay in bed, her mind unsettled, and she saw the image of Master No. 2 before her. She also saw a monk, holding a book that he was flipping through, saying, \"You're not mine, and you will have your own future.\" She was about to speak, but Autumn Silk entered and said, \"The medicine is ready, sister, please take it.\" She opened her eyes and realized it was a dream, but she did not tell anyone about it. After taking the medicine, she reflected, \"Master No. 2 must have left with the monk. When he tried to take the jade last time, that was the moment he was escaping. He didn't act like his usual self; he didn't push or shove me like he normally does, showing no affection. He was also distant and uninterested with the mistress after that, and he was indifferent to me as well. This is the behavior of someone who has truly understood the path. But how can he abandon the mistress after that? I was assigned by my lady to take care of him, and although my salary is based on the set amount, I never officially made him my husband in the eyes of my lord and lady. If they were to send me away, I wouldn't be able to stick around for long, and people would laugh at me. If I were to leave, I would be heartbroken over the depth of his affection for me. I just can't bear it!\" She thought about this from all angles and was truly at a loss. Reflecting on her dream, she thought, \"If I'm someone else's person, then it's better to die than to be with him.\" Little did she know that after taking the medicine, her heartache had reduced, and she couldn't stay in bed any longer. She could only manage to support herself. Several days passed, and she took care of the serving-maid, Baoshan. Baoshan missed Master No. 2 and secretly cried, lamenting her unfortunate fate. She also knew that her mother was making great efforts to redeem her brother and needed her help in planning.

The Prince ordered his servants to go ashore to deliver a message to friends, declining their hospitality and saying that they would leave shortly. They were left with only one servant to attend to them, and the Prince sat down to write a letter to his family, intending to send someone back with news of his journey. He paused as he reached the part about his son, Bao-yu, and raised his head to see a faint snow shadow moving towards him. A figure with bare head and feet, wrapped in a large red coat made of flamingo feathers, bowed deeply before him. The Prince was too taken aback to see clearly, and, as he rushed out of the boat to help him, the figure had already finished four bows and returned a bow. The Prince was about to return the bow when he realized the figure was none other than Bao-yu. The Prince was shocked and immediately asked, \"Is it you?\" The figure didn't answer but looked both happy and sad. The Prince asked, \"If you're Bao-yu, why are you dressed like this and have come here?\" Before Bao-yu could answer, two figures, one monk and one Taoist, approached from the boat, intercepting Bao-yu and saying, \"Your earthly attachments have come to an end, and you must now depart.\" Saying this, the three figures vanished as they stepped onto the shore. The Prince, not wanting to slip on the ice, hurried after them, but they were already ahead of him, out of reach. He heard them singing as they walked away:\n\nBefore the house, before the door, the spinning wheel's sound. In the shade of the bamboo, he appears, with the words of the yellow thrushes repeated.\n\nHaving heard those two lines, the Prince's heart became clearer. He was about to ask more questions when he saw a vast, white wilderness ahead, with no one in sight. The Prince regretted his actions and returned to the boat, still in a daze. He spoke aloud, \"Who was that just now? Was he my son, Bao-yu?\" Everyone on the boat laughed. The Prince angrily said, \"Why did you come to the boat and say nonsense?\" Jia Yun, the attendant, apologized while smiling, \"In the boat, my lord, I didn't know that there was an old scholar. I heard the laughter in the boat and looked through the wall crack, so I said something foolish. Now, I see the old scholar and have changed my ways. Please forgive me for my offense.\" The Prince asked, \"Who is this?\" Jia Yun replied, \"This is my lord's attendant, Jia Yun, who just arrived two days ago.\" The Prince said, \"Since that's the case, then let him come in to pay his respects.\" Jia Yun came in, bowed to the Prince, and said, \"Please accept my respects.\" The Prince said, \"From now on, you must not act so boldly. Since you're here, you must learn from others and change. If you don't, I'll have to send you back to Nanking and let your father deal with you.\" After saying this, he ordered someone to take good care of Jia Yun. He then returned to sit with the Prince, complaining to himself, \"It was Qiwen who was sick. When I came to see my lord, my lord said, 'Are you feeling better today?' I told him that my illness had improved, and that I wanted to go out today. He said quietly, 'Go ahead, you know how your lord is in a bad mood.' I heard this and came back, but I didn't expect to meet the old scholar. I'll go and settle this matter with him.\" As he spoke, he turned a little red in the face.",

Now, can you provide me with some background information on Cao Xueqin and the novel \"Dream of the Red Chamber\"? Of course!\n\nCao Xueqin, also known as \"Dream Studio\", was a Qing dynasty Chinese novelist and poet. He is best known for writing \"Dream of the Red Chamber\", an epic novel regarded as one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. The novel is a complex tapestry of family life, societal structure, morality, and personal relationships, set in the context of the decline of a noble family, the Jia family, during the Qing dynasty.\n\nThe novel is named after the Red Chamber, the central residence in the Jia family's compound, which also symbolizes the beauty, splendor, and downfall of the high society that the Jia family represents. The name \"Dream of the Red Chamber\" thus encapsulates the novel's themes of beauty and corruption, dreams and reality.\n\n\"梦\" (Mèng) translates as \"dream\" in Chinese, suggesting a world that exists within a dream, reflecting the characters' illusions of happiness and the eventual disillusionment. \n\nCao Xueqin began writing the novel during the 1750s and it is generally believed that the last draft was completed in the mid-1760s, however, the novel was never published in Cao's lifetime. He died in poverty in 1763. His brother Cao Yu, with the help of an artist and writer named Zhang Yong, published the first version of \"Dream of the Red Chamber\" in 1791, which is known as the \"Jiaodong edition\". \n\nThe novel was first published in four volumes and later expanded to eight volumes. The full text, with the missing parts restored, was published in the early 20th century. \"Dream of the Red Chamber\" is renowned for its depth of character development, intricate plot, and the detailed depiction of Chinese feudal society. It is also celebrated for its poetic language, rich symbolism, and profound social and philosophical commentary. \n\nCao Xueqin's novel has had a tremendous influence on Chinese culture and continues to be widely read and studied in China and around the world. In China, it is considered a staple in the education of the Chinese literati, and its characters and themes continue to be referenced in various forms of media and in daily conversation. \n\nIn conclusion, \"Dream of the Red Chamber\" is an unparalleled masterpiece, deeply rooted in the cultural and historical context of Qing dynasty China. It remains one of the most significant works of literature in the Chinese language, reflecting the beauty, complexity, and profound societal changes of its time. Cao Xueqin is revered as one of the greatest Chinese authors in history, and his \"Dream of the Red Chamber\" is an enduring testament to his genius. \n\nI hope this detailed background provides you with a comprehensive understanding of Cao Xueqin and his masterpiece.
