Her way of living, eating, and travelling were all the same as those of the Master, with the three granddaughter, Yingchun, Zhenchun, and Xiuchun, being left in the shade. Yet, it was also the case that the intimacy between Lin Daiyu and the Master was different from that with other people. They were together all day and night, and their feelings for each other were harmonious, their conversations and actions in tune with each other and free of conflict. But, it was not expected that later on, a person named Xue Baoshi would come. Although she was older than Lin Daiyu, she had a dignified personality and a beautiful appearance. Many people said that Lin Daiyu was inferior to her. Baoshi also had an easy-going, agreeable disposition, unlike Daiyu who thought of herself as better than others and looked down upon others. Hence, she was deeply loved by the servants. Even the maid servants also tended to be closer to Baoshi. Therefore, Lin Daiyu felt a little aggrieved. But Baoshi was completely unaware of it.",

He followed the fairy into the second gate, and saw that there were pavilions with plaques and couplets on both sides. He could not see all of them, but he did see some that were labeled \"Erudite Love Office\", \"Enmity Office\", \"Morning Sigh Office\", \"Evening Sigh Office\", \"Spring Sentiment Office\", and \"Autumn Sorrow Office.\" Seeing this, he asked the fairy, \"Could you please take me to visit these offices?\" The fairy said, \"These offices contain the records of past and future events for all women in the world. As a mortal, you should not learn about these things first.\" Bao Yu was unwilling to give up, however, and he begged her again. Jinghuang agreed and said, \"Very well, let us visit the 'Desperate Office' within this compound.\" Bao Yu was ecstatic and looked up to see the three-character plaque above the entrance read \"Desperate Office\".

Although clever and skilled, they attract hatred. Their short lives are mostly due to slander, and the affectionate young lords only worry about her.\n\n 2. The Qing Dynasty under Shunzhi Emperor, following the conquest of the Ming Dynasty, had to face the uprising led by Li Zicheng, and the capital, Beijing, was also taken. Emperor Chongzhen of the Ming Dynasty committed suicide, and the Ming Dynasty officially came to an end. Shunzhi Emperor took the throne and, after a period of reflection, decided to treat Han people more favorably. He sent people to慰问 various local governor's offices and promised to share the hardships with the Han people. At the same time, he ordered local officials not to levy taxes on people at will, in order to avoid overburdening the people and causing unrest. Shunzhi Emperor also ordered the release of Ming officials and Han people who were guilty to calm the hearts of the people. He implemented the \"Renaming Fields\" policy, dividing Ming feudal land to be cultivated by farmers, and also collecting land owned by fugitive officials for the state, and distributing it to farmers to cultivate. Shunzhi Emperor abolished the harsh Ming taxes and reduced the amount of taxes collected from the people significantly. These measures improved the stability of society and people's lives to some extent. However, the massacre and plundering of the Qing army after crossing the Great Wall made the lives of the masses even more miserable. The Qing dynasty's \"Circle Land\" policy also caused dissatisfaction and resistance among the Han people. Therefore, while Shunzhi Emperor had many improvements, he could not change the tyranny of the Qing dynasty and the suffering of the people. Shunzhi Emperor repeatedly ordered the prohibition of massacres and the release of abducted Han people, but the effects were not obvious. Under his rule, the tyranny and suffering of the Qing dynasty and the people remained, and people's lives remained extremely miserable. During Shunzhi's reign, the Qing Dynasty also began to manage Tibet, sending the Dalai Lama to Tibet to spread Buddhism and granting titles to the Dalai Lama, strengthening the relationship between Tibet and the central government. Shunzhi Emperor also established close connections with the Mongolian tribes and strengthened control and management over them. Under the reign of Shunzhi Emperor, the Qing Dynasty also conducted multiple wars with Korea, strengthening its control and influence over Korea. These measures had a certain impact on the rise of Qing Dynasty's national strength and international status, but they also brought more suffering to the people. During Shunzhi's reign, the Qing Dynasty's national strength gradually increased, and its national strength and international status improved. However, the oppression and exploitation of the people by the Qing Dynasty also became increasingly severe, and people's lives became even more miserable. These policies and measures had an impact on people's lives, but also brought negative consequences to the Qing Dynasty's rule. During Shunzhi's reign, the Qing Dynasty made significant advancements in politics, economy, military, culture, and other aspects, improving its national strength and international status. However, the oppression and exploitation of the people by the Qing Dynasty also became increasingly severe, and people's lives became more miserable. These policies and measures had an impact on people's lives, but also brought negative consequences to the Qing Dynasty's rule. 3. In Shunzhi's reign, Qing armies invaded Beijing, leading to the collapse of the Ming Dynasty. Shunzhi Emperor pledged to share hardships with the Han people, banning random conscription of laborers, releasing Ming officials and criminals, implementing the \"Renaming Fields\" policy, dividing land for farmers to cultivate, and reducing taxes. These measures helped stabilize society and improve people's lives to some extent. However, the barbarity of Qing armies worsened people's suffering, and the \"Circle Land\" policy later sparked discontent among the Han people. Shunzhi Emperor repeatedly ordered the prohibition of brutality and the release of abducted Han people, but the effects were limited. During his reign, despite improvements, the tyranny and suffering of the Qing Dynasty and the people persisted, and people's lives remained miserable. Shunzhi also strengthened the management of Tibet and Mongolia, and conducted multiple wars with Korea, boosting the Qing Dynasty's national strength and international status, but also increased people's burden. In Shunzhi's reign, although the Qing Dynasty's national strength and international status improved, the oppression and exploitation of the people also intensified, and people's lives became even more miserable. This indicates that during Shunzhi's rule, although the Qing Dynasty made progress, there were issues in handling people's interests and maintaining rule. 4. In the Shunzhi era, Qing armies conquered Beijing, marking the end of the Ming Dynasty. Shunzhi Emperor showed benevolence towards the Han people, promising to share their hardships, forbidding the arbitrary conscription of laborers, releasing Ming officials and those guilty, implementing the \"Renaming Fields\" policy to distribute land to farmers, and reducing taxes. These measures helped stabilize society and improve people's lives to some extent. However, the brutality of Qing armies further exacerbated people's suffering, and the \"Circle Land\" policy later sparked discontent among the Han people. Shunzhi Emperor repeatedly ordered the prohibition of atrocities and the release of abducted Han people, but the results were limited. Under his rule, despite improvements, the tyranny and suffering of the Qing Dynasty and the people continued, and people's lives remained miserable. Shunzhi also strengthened management in Tibet and Mongolia, conducting multiple wars with Korea, which improved the Qing Dynasty's national strength and international status, but also increased people's burdens. Therefore, during Shunzhi's reign, although the Qing Dynasty's national strength and international status improved, the oppression and exploitation of the people became increasingly severe, and people's lives became even more miserable. This suggests that Shunzhi's rule faced challenges in balancing people's welfare and maintaining rule. 5. In the Shunzhi era, the Qing army conquered Beijing, marking the end of the Ming Dynasty.

Ever since two persons sprouted a solitary branch between them, it made her return to her hometown like the fragrance of her essence.\n\nHence, the translation. This line of poetry seems to convey a melancholic tone, possibly referring to a situation where a couple's relationship undergoes a significant change, resulting in a separation that has emotional implications. The imagery of lotus leaves,荷花 (huā), and lotus blossoms, 荷花 (hé huā), is symbolic, often associated with purity, serenity, and perhaps a sense of lost beauty. The mention of a \"single branch\" could be metaphorical for the singular outcome of their relationship, leading to a parting of ways that evokes a sense of nostalgia and sorrow. The last line suggests that, despite this painful change, her essence or spirit finds solace in returning to her roots, symbolized by \"her hometown.\" The poem might be about a lover yearning to return to a simpler, happier time, or perhaps reflecting on the complex emotions tied to personal transformation and the dissolution of close relationships. The overall tone is one of reflection on loss, longing, and the enduring beauty that remains even in the face of change.",

She once stood by the riverside, gazing at the east wind blowing across the river, and imagined her future, tears streaming down her face. In her paintings, there were a few floating clouds and a rushing river. The accompanying inscription read, \"What good is wealth and prosperity? A child lost both parents. In a blink, the sunset, the flowing Xiang River, and the clouds in Chu are all fading.\" She then drew a piece of jade, which fell into a filthy swamp.

Later, he grew cold towards her, in the end, there was a rift among the three, she lamented her misfortune in Jinling.\" Finally, she drew a deserted village with a woman weaving there. The accompanying judgment read, \"Do not speak of your former prestige when power declines, do not mention your family after your household's fall.偶然saved a Mr. Liu, unexpectedly met an benefactor.\" She drew a flourishing orchid, next to a woman dressed in phoenix crown and veil. The accompanying judgment read, \"Flowers and fruits in the春风 of peach and apricot will eventually wither, who can still remain as steadfast as orchids? Even ice is envious of you, your virtues can only be talked about.\" Finally, she drew a tall building with a woman hanging herself. The accompanying judgment read, \"Passions in the world become carnal bodies, when passions meet, it must involve licentiousness. Do not say that all unscrupulous sons are descendants of the荣府, in fact, the beginning of crime is in the Ning府.\"\n\nThey were all sitting there, and suddenly someone from the dark side raised his voice and said, \"Yes, I am willing to take on this responsibility, but there is one thing I need to clarify. In the end, I want to make a suggestion.\"\n\nThis was the first time anyone from the dark side had spoken up, and the atmosphere immediately became tense. The dark side members looked at him with cautious eyes, while the light side members stared at him with suspicion. Everyone's hearts were pounding, and the tension in the air was palpable.\n\nThe one who spoke up was the guy from the dark side who had previously been a bit odd. He had short, choppy black hair and a serious expression on his face. He was wearing a black suit with a white shirt underneath, and he looked like he had been through a lot of things.\n\n\"Okay, you can speak,\" said the person in charge of the meeting. \"What is your suggestion?\"\n\nThe dark side member cleared his throat and said, \"Well, I believe that the problem we are facing is due to the fact that the light side and the dark side are not communicating enough. We need to find a way to bridge the gap between us and work together towards a common goal. My suggestion is to set up a joint committee made up of members from both sides, which can meet regularly to discuss and resolve any issues that arise. This way, we can prevent misunderstandings and work towards a peaceful resolution.\"\n\nThis suggestion was met with mixed reactions. The light side members looked at each other uncertainly, while the dark side members looked at him with a mix of skepticism and curiosity. The person in charge of the meeting nodded thoughtfully and said, \"That's a good point. I think it's a good idea to establish a joint committee. Let's discuss it further and come up with a plan to implement it.\"\n\nThe meeting continued with much more serious and productive discussions, and the atmosphere gradually became more positive. It seemed like the suggestion had been well-received, and the members of both sides were now willing to work together towards a common goal.\n\nThe next day, the joint committee was formed, and the members from both sides started meeting regularly to discuss and resolve any issues that arose. The process was not always smooth, but over time, the members learned to communicate more effectively and trust each other more. The joint committee became a vital tool for resolving conflicts and building bridges between the light and dark sides.\n\nIn the end, the joint committee was successful in resolving several significant issues and improving the relationship between the light and dark sides. The members of both sides realized that by working together, they could achieve greater things than they could ever accomplish alone. This led to the creation of a more harmonious society, where the light and dark sides were able to coexist peacefully.\n\nTranslate the following from Chinese to English:\n\n如果真要讲，马克思确实在《德意志意识形态》中提到过人的社会性。马克思认为人是社会的产物，因为人不能离开社会而存在。马克思社会学分析的核心是社会关系。他指出，人与人之间的关系在社会中是至关重要的。人们共同生活、工作、学习、娱乐，这些关系构成了社会的结构。他强调，社会关系决定了个人的行为和价值观念。\n\n翻译:\n\nIf one were to truly delve into it, Marx indeed alluded to human sociability in The German Ideology. Marx believed that humans are products of society because humans cannot exist without society. The core of Marx's sociological analysis is the relationship between individuals. He pointed out that the relationships between people are crucial in society. People live, work, study, and entertain together, and these relationships form the structure of society. He emphasized that social relationships determine individual behavior and values.\n\nIn this passage, the author discusses how Marx views human sociability within the context of society. He emphasizes the importance of social relationships in shaping human behavior and values, and how these relationships form the basis of societal structure. The author also highlights Marx's belief that humans are fundamentally social creatures, unable to exist in isolation, and that the collective social environment significantly influences individual actions and beliefs.",

Why did you bring this polluted thing instead, polluting our pure world of women?\"\n\nIn a state of daze, and without any awareness of what he was doing, Baoyu laid down the scroll in his hand, following Jinghuan behind. He found himself in a place adorned with exquisitely painted eaves and pillars, and adorned with pearls and silk curtains, with fragrant flowers and aromatic grasses filling the air. This was truly a splendid spot! As the saying goes, \"Golden light gleams on the red door, while snow blankets the pearl curtain.\" And then, before he could even finish Jinghuan's sentence, he saw several fairies stepping out of the room. Their garments flowed gracefully, their bird-like costumes twirled, and they appeared as lovely as spring flowers and as gentle as the moon on a cool autumn night. On seeing Baoyu, they all reproached Jinghuan, saying, \"We didn't know who the esteemed guest was, so we rushed out to greet him.

While passing by the Ning Mansion, I met the spirits of the Ning and Rong ancestors. They said to me: ‘Our family has had fame and wealth for generations since the founding of the Qing Dynasty. Our fortune has lasted for hundreds of years. But our family's luck is coming to an end and there's nothing we can do about it! We have a large number of descendants, but there's no one to carry on our legacy. Only Yu Ba, our grandson, has a peculiar personality and behaves strangely. Although he's smart and clever, maybe he can grow, but our family's luck is at its end and there's no one to guide him on the right path. Fortunately, you've come. Can you use sexual pleasure, sound and color to enlighten his stupidity and make him escape from this maze of attractions and take the right path? This would also be a blessing for us brothers.' They entrust this task to me, so I've come with compassion. I'll guide him here. I first showed him the records of all the ladies in our family, but he still didn't get it. Therefore, I'm bringing him here to let him enjoy the illusions of various feasts, drinks, and music. Perhaps, someday he'll have a breakthrough. It's not certain.\" Finished speaking, she pulled him into the room. A faint fragrance could be sensed, but no one knew what it was. Yu Ba couldn't help asking, \"What kind of fragrance is this? I've never seen it before in this world.\" Jin Liang responded with a cold laugh, \"This fragrance doesn't exist in this world. How could you know?

It might suggest someone who has realized the impermanence of life's joys and is seeking inner peace or wisdom in understanding this.\n\nHowever, without more information about the specific usage within the text or its broader context, the translation remains somewhat abstract.

Illusory Flower Enlightenment\n2. Transient Blossom Realization\n3. Fickle Flower Wisdom\n\nEach of these translations offers a slightly different nuance based on the individual interpretation of \"虚\" as \"empty\" or \"illuminating\" (\"悟\"). The second one emphasizes the transient nature, while the third could imply a kind of wisdom gained from understanding impermanence. The first combines both concepts, suggesting both the illusory aspect of life and the enlightenment or understanding that comes from this realization.

It is true that fornication means the same as reading books, but the meaning is different.

You, however, are one who is naturally affectionate towards girls, and we call this a kind of fornication.

Now that you have been given these words by the ancestors of your family, you can understand that it is not a good thing for you to be in a world that despises you. Therefore, I brought you here, so that you could drink the best wine, eat the best tea, listen to the best music, and most importantly, meet my little sister who I will call Xiamei, whose other name is Keqing.
