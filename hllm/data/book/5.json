Now, let's talk about what happened to Lin Daiyu since she moved into Rong府. Grandmother Xie showed her boundless love to Lin Daiyu, and she and her grandson, Yu, were treated the same way. The three granddaughters, Ying, Tan, and Xi, were left behind. The intimacy and closeness between Lin Daiyu and Yu Yu were also different from others, and they walked and sat together during the day, and slept and rested together at night. They were in harmony and had no enmity. Now, suddenly, a Xue Baochai came, although she was a little older, but she was dignified and beautiful, and many people thought that Lin Daiyu was inferior to her. Baochai's behavior was open-minded and she followed the times, unlike Lin Daiyu's self-styled superiority and contempt for the lower classes, so she was deeply loved by the lower classes. Even the small maids liked Baochai better. Therefore, Lin Daiyu felt a little resentful. Baochai, however, was unaware of this.",

Now that he is living with Jia Laohu, he is more familiar with the other girls. Familiarity breeds intimacy, and intimacy sometimes leads to misunderstandings. One day, for no apparent reason, the two of them had a disagreement. Lin Daiyu was crying alone in her room. Jia Baoyu regretted his rash words and went over to reconcile with her, and Lin Daiyu gradually reconciled with him.",
