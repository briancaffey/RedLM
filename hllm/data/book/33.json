I translated this in a straightforward manner, using a simple sentence structure to convey the idea of the servants observing the situation.\n\n2. The phrase \"咬着手指头，咂着舌头\" is an idiom that refers to biting one's tongue, which means \"to be silent or cautious.\" I translated this as \"biting their fingers,\" which conveys the same meaning in English.\n\n3. The use of \"叠连声\" means \"one after another\" or \"repeatedly.\" I translated this as \"one after another\" to maintain the rhythm of the original text.\n\n4. The sentence \"宝玉，宝玉，拿过来！打他！拿绳子，拿大棍，把门关上！不许告诉太太！谁告诉太太，立刻打死！\" is a command and threat from a frustrated parent to their child.
