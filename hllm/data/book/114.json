The Wang family has no men of character. We've been in mourning for our great-grandmother, so it's not surprising that no one was invited. It was all arranged by Ernian. As for the rest of the relatives, there are a few, but I've never visited them, so how do you know? If you really think about it, the two of us have similar fates. I was originally promised in marriage to her older brother. My mother wanted to have a grand wedding, but then her older brother went to prison, and she didn't want a big ceremony anyway. We were also in mourning for her mother-in-law, and the family situation was too difficult. After she'd worked hard to support her husband, her mother-in-law was killed by a mob, and her husband became a target of the hard-hearted upper-class woman. That must have been terrible for her. So I convinced my mother to settle for a simpler marriage. It seems she now has a better attitude towards my mother. She is even more respectful than a real daughter-in-law. She gets along well with Xiangling. When Ernian is away, they get along very well and live a peaceful life. They're not wealthy, but my mother has been much more comfortable recently. She misses her brother, which is sad. I hear she's often visiting the family home, which is nice, because Ernian sends her money for the things she needs. I know she has already given up the city homes, and she's thinking of moving to the countryside.\"\n\nYu Baoyu said, \"Why move? It's so convenient for you to come and go here. If you moved further away, you'd have to travel all day.\" Lin Cao'er said, \"We're family, but it's better for us to live separately. Why would you want to live with a relative for your entire life?

            "english": "Next, the Empress dowager had been away for more than ten days, and the funeral preparations were all done. Since his mother’s death, Mr. Jia Zhen had been in mourning. He was living in his study. The number of the so-called erudite gentlemen he had employed had gradually diminished until it was just Cheng Rixing left to keep him company. Whenever the topic was raised of the decline in the family’s fortunes, of the many dead relatives and of the two sons who were still away from home, Mr. Jia Zhen was reminded of the year-on-year increase in expenses, and of the costs associated with the two sons. Then there were the debts which had accumulated from outside the family, and the recent misfortune which had resulted in the loss of considerable property. There was no way to know how the farm estates were faring. In short, everything was going downhill. Cheng Rixing said, \"I have been with you for a number of years, and I know that every member of the family is a person who takes care of his own. Year by year, they take from home, so naturally the family is in shorter supply of money year after year. Added to that are the expenses of Mr. Jia Zhen and Mr. Jia Zhen. On top of that there are debts to be paid to outside creditors. Then there was the recent loss. It is not easy to catch the thief and reclaim the money that was lost. If you want to restore order, you should call the managers of the household to account and send someone you can trust to verify the accounts. You should get rid of those who are not up to the job, and keep those who are competent. If there is a deficit, it should be made up by the person who has been in charge of the deficit. This is the way to go. Nobody is brave enough to buy the property in that large garden, so it is a treasure trove of sorts, and no one is actually in charge of it. For all these years, you have been away, and these people have been so stupid as not to dare to set foot in that garden, that’s what it means when people say that the people of the family are a disgrace. I suggest that you do a thorough check of the servants. Keep the good ones and get rid of the bad ones. That is how it should be done.\" Mr. Jia Zhen nodded in approval and said, \"Mr. Cheng, you are wrong! It is not just the servants who are unreliable. Even your own relatives can be untrustworthy! If you wanted me to check, I don’t know how many there would be. Furthermore, I am still in mourning and am unable to take care of these things. I have never really been involved in the running of the household, and I don’t even know how things are going on.\" Cheng Rixing said, \"You are the most humane person I have ever met. In other families, if the house was in such a state, it would take ten or five years to fall into the poor state that it is in, but the servants would not mind and would be willing to help to ease the financial burden. I have heard that you have a servant who is now the head of a county.\" Mr. Jia Zhen said, \"If a servant were to draw upon the household’s money, the situation would be quite serious. It is only right that I should cut my expenses. But the accounts will tell the story if the property listed in the book has not been sold. I fear that the figure given is nothing more than a theory.\" Cheng Rixing said, \"You are absolutely right, sir. Why did I mention the idea of checking the accounts?\" Mr. Jia Zhen said, \"You must have heard something!\" Cheng Rixing said, \"I know a little about the servants’ tricks, but I dare not mention them.\" Mr. Jia Zhen said, \"I see that you have been privy to some information, Mr. Cheng. I am truly sad to hear this. The ancestors of the Jia family have been generous and never cruel to the servants. But now, the servants are acting worse and worse, and have actually started to behave like masters. I fear that people will think ill of me for this!\"",
