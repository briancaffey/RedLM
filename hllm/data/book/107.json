The grand councilors then asked, \"You know that your brother, in collusion with the local officials, has used his influence to exploit the people, and has allowed his son to conspire in gambling, and has seized the property of the poor people. Finally, he was forced to death. Is that so?\" Jia Zheng answered, \"Since my lord the emperor has bestowed me with his grace, I have been appointed as the governor of education. I was home during the winter when I made inquiries about the relief of poverty and famine. Later, I was ordered to oversee the construction project, and then I was appointed as the chief of grain distribution in Jiangxi. I was recalled to the capital after the investigation and have continued to do my work in the Ministry of Works. I have never been lax in my duty. I have neglected my family matters because I am totally absorbed in my work. I am sorry that I have not been able to raise my family properly and thus mislead my relatives and nephews. I deserve a severe punishment for misusing my grace.\" After hearing this, the Prince of the Northern Peace transferred the case to the emperor.",

            "english": "Soon the emperor issued an edict, and the Duke of Bei Jing replied that it was because a court official had implicated Jia Shuai in conspiracy with local officials, making use of his power to intimidate people. According to the court official, Jia Shuai had frequently been in contact with Ping An Prefecture. It was alleged that Jia Shuai had intervened in the legal cases of Ping An Prefecture. Therefore, he was severely interrogated. Jia Shuai admitted that the reason for his frequent contact with Ping An Prefecture was because the two parties were originally relatives, and Ping An Prefecture had not interfered in official affairs. There was no concrete evidence for the court official's claim. The only thing for which Jia Shuai could be held accountable was his taking possession of the fans of Shi Daizi. The fans were antiques, unlike the common theft of the possessions of ordinary people. Shi Daizi had taken his own life because he had gone mad, not because he had been forced to death. Now, given a lenient treatment, Jia Shuai was exiled to the border regions to serve and expiate his crime. As for Jia Zhen's forcibly occupying a civilian wife and daughter as concubines and then forcing them to take their lives, according to the records of the Supervisory Board of the Grand Secretariat, Yu E was originally engaged to Zhang Hua in her womb. Due to Zhang Hua's poverty, Yu E had voluntarily withdrawn her engagement. Her mother was willing to give her daughter to Jia Zhen as a concubine, so it could not be considered as a forcible occupation. Moreover, Yu San had taken her own life without reporting it to the authorities. Because Yu San was Jia Zhen's brother-in-law, the intention behind her suicide was to choose a husband for her, but because she had been compelled to accept a deposit, the public had slandered her, leading to her humiliation and suicide, rather than being forced to death by Jia Zhen. However, Jia Zhen, being a hereditary official, was ignorant of laws and regulations, and had buried someone's death without due process. He should have been severely punished, but in consideration of his being a descendant of a distinguished official, it was not easy to impose a punishment, so he was treated leniently, his official position was revoked, and he was sent to serve and expiate his crime in the maritime frontier. As for Jia Rong, who was young and had no involvement in the matter, he was released. Jia Zheng, who had served as an official for many years, was considered to have been diligent and careful in his duties, so he was exempted from the punishment for mismanagement of his family.",

We deserve to die a hundred deaths!\"\n\n\"The Old Lady\" refers to the matriarch of the Jia family, often known as Old Lady Jia or the Old Dowager Countess Jia. The sentence structure here is a bit complex, featuring a series of actions and emotions. \"贾母正在发愁\" means \"The Old Lady was in a quandary\", indicating she was troubled or worried about something. \"只见\" is a conjunction meaning \"all of a sudden\" or \"only then did she see\", setting the scene of the unexpected arrival of the three Jia brothers. \n\nThe sequence of actions \"一把抓住贾赦和贾珍\" means \"she seized them\", showing the immediate and perhaps sudden reaction of the Old Lady upon seeing the brothers. The phrase \"大哭起来\" directly translates to \"broke out crying\", emphasizing the intensity of her emotional response. \n\nThe brothers' reactions \"两人脸上羞愧难当\" translate to \"both felt extremely ashamed\", showing their guilt and embarrassment. The sentence \"又让您老人家伤心\" means \"have now also saddened your old self\", highlighting their awareness of the pain they have caused. The final phrase \"我们是死有余辜啊\" is a stronger statement of remorse, essentially saying \"we deserve to die a hundred deaths\", a highly dramatic expression of guilt and regret. \n\nIn the context of the traditional Chinese language, such expressions can be deeply emotional and powerful, capturing the nuances of familial honor, filial duty, and the deep emotional connections within a Chinese family structure. This particular excerpt seems to be taken from a classic Chinese novel, possibly \"Dream of the Red Chamber\" (Jia Zhen Chuang), a masterpiece of Chinese literature. The language here is rich with cultural and historical context, reflecting the deep emotional bonds and strict social hierarchies of the time. \n\nThe translation maintains the essence and dramatic intensity of the original text, aiming to capture the emotional depth and the complex narrative in English. The dialogue is presented in a conversational tone, using direct and straightforward language that is easy to understand, while still maintaining the poetic and archaic flavor characteristic of classical Chinese narratives. \n\nOverall, the translation skillfully navigates the intricate blend of emotional and social dynamics, successfully conveying the essence of the scene in a way that resonates with both the original Chinese audience and English-speaking readers alike.

They all celebrated his good fortune. But, despite his pure nature, the Duke was anxious about this turn of events, only thanking the Emperor for his grace.
