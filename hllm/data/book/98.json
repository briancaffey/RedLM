After a few days, when the doctor came over, the medicine didn’t help. Bao Yu couldn’t even be recognized. When they propped him up, he seemed to be in one piece. This went on for a few days. That day was the ninth day of the month. If Bao Yu didn’t go, Xue Miaoyi would not be happy. But if he did, then, as the old lady knew that it was due to Lin Daiyu, she was afraid he would get even worse. Xue Baochai was a new wife, so it would be hard for her to offer consolation. They had to invite Xue Miaoyi over. If they didn’t, Xue Miaoyi would be angry. So the old lady, Lady Wang and Feng Zhiming discussed, \"I think that Bao Yu is just acting weird. He should be able to go out. Send out two little sedan chairs, and let people hold him up. Go through the garden, which will make up for the good luck of the ninth day. After that, invite Xue Miaoyi over to comfort Baochao. We will all join hands to care for Bao Yu. That will be a win-win situation.\"",

But no one could figure out what was wrong. There was only one poor doctor living in a rundown temple in the city who was called Shiguan by his nickname. He had diagnosed that the cause of the illness was due to overindulgence in pleasure or sorrow, imbalance in hot and cold, irregular eating habits, and emotional distress. The sickness was a result of internal and external factors blocking the flow of Qi. The doctor then prescribed a tailor-made treatment plan. After drinking the medicine at night, the symptoms began to subside, and he was able to drink water by midnight.

The others were worried that Bao-yu might be too upset, so they tried to console him. Bao-yu had already wept until he was near death, and everyone had to help him rest. The others who had come with him, such as Bao-chao, were also deeply affected. But Bao-yu insisted on seeing Zhi-juan, demanding to know what Lin Daiyu had said in her last moments. Zhi-juan, who had long harbored a grudge against Bao-yu, softened her stance when she saw him in such distress. With both Grandmother Jia and Madam Wang present, she dared not offend him. So she told him everything that had happened to Lin Daiyu - how she had worsened, how she had burned her handkerchief, how she had burned her poems, and every last thing she had said before she died. Bao-yu wept once again until he could barely breathe. Qian-chun took the opportunity to recount Lin Daiyu's final request to be buried in her native southern province.
