The group consists of Xì Rén, Qing Wén, Shī Yuè, Qiū Wén, Fāng Guān, Bì Hèn, Chūn Yàn, and Sì Er, each paying their share. Jia Baoyu expresses his happiness at this initiative and reminds everyone that it's not necessary to feel awkward or uncomfortable about the cost.

You're quite right; we're dying for them.\" The girls pushed him away, scolding angrily, \"You've got no heart! You've got a wife, and you're still trying to fool around with us! If you know you're just playing around, then you can do what you like, but if someone else finds out and thinks you're messing with us, spreading our private affairs around, it could get back to the people over there and they'd say we're up to all sorts of things.\" Jia Rong laughed, \"Who's interfering in whose business? We can do whatever we like. Even in the old days, people talked about the shamefulness of the Han and Tang dynasties. How could we, a family like this, be any better? Who doesn't have some kind of scandal in their family? Don't let me tell you. Even Lord Bao, who's such a powerful man, has something going on with his maid-mother, Second Uncle Liu! Even Shuang Sis, who's so firm, gets on with Little Uncle Wei's business! Have I missed anything?\" Jia Rong rambled on. Sanniang's expression darkened, and she climbed down from the bed to enter the inner room, waking up You Laomang.",

Leaving us here, are you planning to become a mother for your father?\" Jia Rong then spoke to his grandmother, \"Don't worry, father has been worried about the two aunts, trying to find wealthy and well-established families with young, lively men for them. He wants to get them married. It's been a few years since he found anyone suitable, but he happened to meet a good match yesterday.\" Mrs. You believed him and asked, \"Who is it?\" The second sister put down her work, giggled, and hit him, saying, \"Mother, don't believe this liar!\" The third sister said, \"Rong'er!
