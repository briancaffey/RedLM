Zhi Juan climbed onto the bed, approached Lady Lin Daiyu, held the water, tested the temperature, and sent it to her lips. She supported Lady Lin Daiyu's head and sent the water to her mouth.

In this context, \"侍书\" is a person who is responsible for attending to the needs of the speaker, who is a female character named \"黛玉\" (literally \"Dark Jade\").\n\nThe phrase \"因连忙过来问候\" means \"came over to greet them.\" This indicates that the attendant scholar rushed over to greet the speaker and her companions, likely because they were waiting for him or had been expecting him to arrive.\n\nThe speaker, \"黛玉,\" is then introduced as the female character who is being addressed. When \"黛玉\" opens her eyes, she nods in acknowledgement of the attendant scholar's greeting, indicating that she has recognized him and is aware of his presence. After a brief rest, \"黛玉\" speaks again, this time telling the attendant scholar to tell her sister to say hello. This suggests that \"黛玉\" is part of a larger family or group of people, and that the sister she is referring to is someone close to her.\n\nFinally, the attendant scholar, \"侍书,\" sees the situation and realizes that \"黛玉\" is tired and wants to rest. He quietly leaves the room, indicating that he understands the speaker's needs and is willing to accommodate them. This shows that \"侍书\" is a considerate and attentive person who is willing to go above and beyond to ensure the well-being of the speaker.",

The old lady said: \"I was just about to tell you that the younger brother and Lin Daiyu have been playing together since they were children. I only thought they were children and didn't mind. I often hear that Lin Daiyu suddenly falls ill and suddenly gets better, which is because she has some feelings. So I think that if they stay together all the time, it's not right. What do you think?\" Wang Lady listened and was silent for a while, and could only answer: \"Lin is a girl with a mind, and as for the younger brother, he is a little stupid and naive. From the outside, he still looks like a child. If we separate them, won't it be obvious? The old saying goes 'boys must marry when they grow up and girls must marry when they grow up'. I think we should just get married.\" The old lady frowned and said: \"Lin's eccentricity, although it is one of her advantages, I don't want to marry Lin to the younger brother for this reason. Also, Lin is not a girl who is lucky, and Bao is the best choice. \" Wang Lady said: \"Not only did the old lady say so, but we also thought so.\"\"But Lin Erhuang also needs to be given a suitor before she can be married off, otherwise, girls do have their own worries. If she knew that Baoyu was engaged to Baoguang, it wouldn't be good.\" Grandmother said, \"Of course, we have to marry Baoyu first and then find a suitor for Lin Erhuang. There's no such thing as putting others before oneself. Besides, Lin Erhuang is two years younger than Baoyu. If you do it like that, it's like Baoyu is already engaged. It would be better not to tell him.\" Then, the lady-in-waiting said to the other girls, \"Did you hear that? Don't talk about Baoyu's engagement. If anyone tells, I'll slap their faces.\" Grandmother then said to the lady-in-waiting, \"Xiaohua, you've been taking care of the garden for a while now. I want you to take some responsibility. Not only for the garden, but also for the things like people drinking and gambling, which are not good.

Which city had the decrease in the amount of water in the aquifer?  Two cities had different water sources. Kity city used fossil water, while Pome city used surface water.  Hint: Surface water can be fresh or salt water. It includes rivers, lakes, and groundwater. Groundwater is sometimes called “renewable water” because it is constantly being replenished by rain and melted snow. About 97 percent of Earth’s water is salty or bitter, and most of that salt water is in the oceans. The rest of Earth’s water is fresh water. Fresh water comes mainly from ice caps and glaciers. Fresh water is also found in lakes, rivers, and groundwater. Our fresh water resources are finite. That means they cannot be renewed as quickly as we use them. So conservation is very important when we use fresh water.\nThe answer is:\nKity city had the decrease in the amount of water in the aquifer.\n\nPlease answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Fink, a former director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's Research and Development Division, suggested improvements in the security of the design, including the addition of a watermark and a security thread embedded in the paper, as used on the current US passport.\nThe answer to this question is: The incident in which a group of people could not use a public space is not mentioned in the given context.\n\nPlease answer the following question: Here is a review left by a customer on a product.
