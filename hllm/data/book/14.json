Eight of you will be in charge of accepting the offerings of the mourning relatives. Eight more of you will be responsible for lighting and keeping the lamps and candles in all parts of the compound, as well as the incense sticks, paper offerings, etc. I have already paid for all these, and have given them to the eight of you to distribute according to my instructions. The twenty servants in charge of night watch will patrol the compound, inspect the lights, and clean the place. The rest will be divided into groups according to the different rooms, and each group will be responsible for what belongs to that room, including the furniture, the decorative things, the bed and the mats, the cover and the carpet, the ashtrays and the brooms, etc. The same thing will happen to them if something is missing. Laisheng's wife is in charge of collecting all these and will be doing this on a daily basis. No one will be able to escape work. Gambling, drinking, fighting, or any form of quarreling will not be tolerated. If I find out about it, you will lose your face, and I will not tolerate any form of evasion or cheating. After this, everything will be regulated. Anyone who wants to do something out of the ordinary will be punished. Everyone is now used to the system. I have my own watch and everyone else in the family also has their own watches. Big events and small events all have a specific time. You also have the watch in your rooms.

She then collected all the dishes, mats, quilts, carpets, ashtrays, and other items, and distributed them to the servants, making sure that they were well-informed of their responsibilities.

He asked Jia Zhen, \"Which one is that boy born with a jade? I've been looking forward to seeing him for a long time. Why hasn't he come?\" Jia Zhen hurriedly stepped back, ordered Bao Yuyu to change his clothes, and led him forward to meet the Prince Regent.",
            "chinese": "走不多时，路上搭起彩棚，张起桌椅，奏起音乐，两边都是给逝去的亲人摆下的路祭。第一棚是东平郡王府的祭，第二棚是南安郡王的祭，第三棚是西宁郡王的祭，第四棚便是北静郡王的祭。原来这四位王中，北静王的功劳最高，至今子孙仍能袭王位。北静王世子荣刚刚成年，生得英俊异常，性格温文尔雅。近日听说宁国府的族孙妇去世，因为想到祖父辈之间有过交往，同甘共苦，所以不以王位自居，前天也去探丧吊唁，今天又设下路祭，在身边官吏的陪同下在此等候。五更时分，他入朝处理公事，事毕换上素服，坐着大轿，鸣锣举伞而来，到了棚前下了轿。手下官吏两旁侍候，军民人等不得通过。不久，只听宁府的大丧浩浩荡荡，如同银山一般从北面而来。早有宁府的开路传事人报与贾珍，贾珍急忙让前面的执事停下，与贾赦、贾政三人连忙迎上来，按照国礼相见。北静王在轿内欠身，含笑还礼，依然以世交称呼接待，并不自大。贾珍说：“亡妻之丧，多蒙王驾亲临，作为低下的读书人，如何承受得起！”北静王笑道：“世交至谊，何必说这些话？”于是回头令长府官主祭代奠。贾赦等人在一旁还礼，又亲自来谢。北静王十分谦逊，因问贾政道：“那位是衔玉而诞者？我早就想见一见，今日一定在此，怎么不请来？”贾政急忙退下，命宝玉更衣，领他前来拜见。"
