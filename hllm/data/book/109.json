I have to do something to save her!\" The old woman said, \"That's the problem! You're too worried about her, and you can't think clearly. I'll tell you something very important. The old lady has been ill for quite some time. Now that you've moved her, you have to take care of her properly. Don't let her touch the ground. Don't let her be in a state of worry or fear. Don't let her eat raw food. Don't let her be in a place with a draft. Don't let her drink cold water. Don't let her walk around outside. Don't let her sit in a place that's too cold or too hot. Don't let her touch metal or anything cold. Don't let her drink tea. Don't let her eat too much. Don't let her drink wine or eat any spicy food. Don't let her be exposed to the wind. Don't let her be in a place with too much light. Don't let her see the wind. Don't let her cry. Don't let her laugh. Don't let her sleep. Don't let her wake up. If you do all these things, and the old lady still doesn't get better, then you have to go see a doctor. You have to take her to see a doctor!\" Jia Zong was very happy to hear this. He said, \"You're right! I should listen to your advice. Now that you've told me what to do, I can take care of her properly!\" The old woman said, \"There's one more thing you have to do. When you're taking care of her, make sure to cook some hot soup for her. I'll come back tomorrow to check on the old lady. If she's better, then I'll come back. If she's worse, then I'll come back.\" Jia Zong said, \"All right! I'll follow your advice!\" The old woman said, \"You can trust me. I won't let you down!\" Jia Zong was very grateful to the old woman, and thanked her profusely. He then asked, \"Why did you come here?\" The old woman said, \"I came here because I heard that the old lady was sick. I wanted to come and check on her.
