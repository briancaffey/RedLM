When you say it, you must use clean water and sweet tea to rinse your mouth. If you make a mistake, you will cut your teeth and eyes. Its violence and ignorance are all different.

However, the student I was supposed to tutor was more demanding than a typical student. He said, 'I must have two daughters to accompany me while I study, or I won't be able to read the texts or understand them. It's just too hard without them.' He also instructed his servants, 'The word \"daughter\" is very sacred and precious, even more so than rare animals, exotic plants, or other precious things.
