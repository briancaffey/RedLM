Didn't Jia Rong remember that his aunt had suddenly fallen sick as she was returning from the garden the day before? Although they had not seen anything, the servants had told them that it was some kind of beast with eyes as big as lanterns, and it could speak. This had frightened the aunt into a fit. Jia Rong replied that he remembered. He said that according to Beiming, the former servant, Qiong Wen had been made the Flower Goddess of the garden. Since Lin Yuan had passed away, there was music floating in the air, so she must have become the Flower Goddess of some flower. Thinking about all those monsters in the garden, it was really terrifying.

But in the quiet garden now, it was unknown which flower his mother might have accidentally stepped on or run into. The fortune-teller had been quite accurate.
