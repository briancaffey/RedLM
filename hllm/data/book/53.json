            "english": "Translation:\n\nJia Mu once sent someone to invite relatives, and some were too old to be bothered with festivities. Others had no one to attend to at home, and some were sick and unable to come. Some were jealous of wealth and ashamed of poverty, so they did not come. Others were angry with Jia Feng, so they refused to come. Some were too embarrassed to come. Therefore, despite the many relatives, only Lou Li and her son Jia Lan came, while the men were only Jia Xin, Jia Yun, Jia Chang, and Jia Ling, all of whom worked in Jia's household. At the family banquet, it was still lively.\n\n在老屋的后园里，有两棵枣树。这枣树都是古木，绝不是栽的，从什么时候就有了，谁也说不清。树干不直，有许多横生的枝杈，枝上又生出密密的细刺。春天，长叶之前，开满一树的小白花。老屋已经很破旧了，唯有这两棵枣树却长得粗壮茂盛。树冠像一把撑开的伞，高高的树杈快要碰到屋顶了。树皮是黑褐色的，像老人饱经风霜的脸。春天，绿叶满枝，像燃起绿色的火焰；夏天，硕大的红枣挂满枝头，像许多绿色的小灯笼；秋天，红枣红了，缀满枝头，像无数颗红宝石；冬天，枣树上落满雪花，像两棵银色的圣诞树，可爱极了。\n\nTranslation:\n\nIn the back garden of the old house, there were two mulberry trees. These mulberry trees were ancient, not planted, and no one could say how long ago they were planted. The tree trunks were not straight, with many horizontal branches, and there were many dense thorns on the branches. Before the leaves came out in spring, there were small white flowers all over the tree. The old house was already very old, but these two mulberry trees were still strong and prosperous. The tree canopy was like an open umbrella, with high tree branches almost touching the roof. The bark was black-brown, like an old man's face with many wrinkles. In spring, green leaves covered the tree, like a green flame burning brightly; in summer, large mulberries grew on the branches, like many green lanterns; in autumn, the mulberries turned red and were full of branches, like countless red rubies; in winter, the mulberry tree was covered with snow, like two silver Christmas trees, very lovely.",

            "english": "Currently, Lin Zhihao's wife, accompanied by six other wives, carried three tables with red mats on each, each table displaying a group of newly minted, uniform-sized copper coins, with red strings threading through them. Each pair of wives carried one table, a total of three. Lin Zhihao's wife instructed the two pairs to place two tables under the seats of Xue Paima and Li Wenchang, and one table under the bed of Old Mistress. Old Mistress said, \"Just leave them there.\" This wife, well-acquainted with the rules, placed the tables down and removed the red strings, piling the coins on the table. At this moment, the performance of West Mountain Meeting was nearing its end, and Yu Shuyi had left in a huff. Wenbao then made a humorous remark, saying, \"You left in a huff. Today is the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, when the old mistress and her family are having a banquet at the Rongguo Mansion. I'm going to ride this horse over to ask for some fruits to eat.\" He concluded with a laugh, causing Old Mistress, Xue Paima, and Li Wenchang to say, \"What a clever little brat!\" Auntie Feng said, \"This child is only nine years old.\" Old Mistress smiled, saying, \"He speaks so cleverly.\" She then said, \"Let's give him some money.\" As soon as the word \"give\" was spoken, three servants had already prepared small baskets. Upon hearing \"give,\" they approached, scooping up the scattered coins from the table into their baskets, and then, with the coins in hand, they went to the stage and said, \"Old mistress, Aunt Xue, and Aunt Li are giving money to Wenbao to buy fruits with.\"The translation of the given Chinese text to English is as follows:\n\nAs he said, he threw up his hand towards the stage, and heard a clatter of coins all over the stage. Jia Zhen and Jia Lian had already called the young servants to prepare large baskets of coins.\n\nIn this sentence, the speaker is throwing coins onto the stage, which causes a loud noise. Jia Zhen and Jia Lian, who are presumably present at the event, have instructed their servants to prepare large baskets of coins for something. The context of the sentence is not provided, but it seems to be part of a larger narrative or scene.",
