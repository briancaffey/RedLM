After the two of them took turns kneading for a while, they had only managed to eat a few mouthfuls of food before the sky had already brightened. Bai Yu did not leave the house, but instead ordered that a doctor be quickly summoned. Not long after, Doctor Wang arrived. After taking Qiong Wen's pulse, he said with doubt, \"Her condition had improved yesterday, but why is she weaker today? It might be because she ate too much or thought too much. The symptoms of an external infection might have lessened, but the aftercare after sweating is not something to be taken lightly.\" Following this, Doctor Wang prescribed a medicine. After Bai Yu read it, he noticed that the medicine for dispersing evil spirits had been reduced, and additional medicines such as Chinese angelica, rehmannia root, and peach kernel had been added, which could nourish the mind and blood. As Bai Yu hurriedly ordered someone to prepare the medicine, he lamented, \"What can I do about this? If something happens to Qiong Wen, it will all be my fault!\" Qiong Wen lay in bed, sighing, \"Caring master, you go about your business. It's not like I have tuberculosis, there's no need to be so worried!\"",

The rules of the Jia Family were that, regardless of status, anyone who caught a cold or cough would be given a diet of food that would be forbidden until they were well, and only then would medicine be used to treat and recover. Therefore, Qiongwen had been on a diet of forbidden food for two or three days at the start of her illness, and had been careful to take medicine to recover. Although she was a little tired now, after days of extra care and treatment, her condition was gradually improving.

Yubei carried the incense while Jia Chu and Jia Ling spread the altar mats. The sacrificial rituals were completed, and the incense was extinguished and the offerings removed. The whole family then gathered around the elders in the main hall, where the ancestors’ portraits were displayed. The portraits were of the ancestors wearing dragon robes and carrying jade sashes. There were also portraits of their ancestors on either side of the main hall. Jia Xing and Jia Zhi stood in a line from the Inner Ceremony Gate to the main hall’s廊下 (columned passage). Jia Jing and Jia Sheng stood on the balustrade of the main hall. The ladies of the family stood inside the balustrade, and the servants stood outside the ceremony gate. Every dish was passed through the ceremony gate, and Jia Xing and Jia Zhi received the dishes and passed them in order to Jia Jing’s hands. Since Jia Rong was the eldest grandson of the first generation, he stood with the ladies of the family inside the balustrade. Each time Jia Rong received a dish, he passed it to his wife, who then passed it to the other ladies, until it reached the altar. The ladies then passed the dishes to Wangfei, who finally placed them on the table. Xingfei stood opposite the altar, facing east, and assisted Wangfei in the sacrificial rite. After all the dishes, rice, soup, tea, and alcohol had been passed, Jia Rong withdrew to his place next to Jia Xin. The men who bore the names of books, jades, and plants were Jia Jing, Jia Zhen, and Jia Rong, respectively. The men were arranged on the right, and the women on the left, in accordance with their family’s lineage. When the elders had lit their incense and bowed, the entire family knelt down. The five large halls and three annexes, as well as the outer and inner corridors, were packed with people, and there was not even a sliver of open space.

It just happens to be the 15th of the first lunar month, the Lantern Festival, and there's a family banquet at the old matriarch's residence at the Rongguo Mansion. This kid here can ride this horse into the banquet hall and beg for fruit.\" At this, they all burst into laughter. \"This child is so resourceful,\" said the rest of the ladies, \"Poor little thing.\" \"He's only nine years old,\" said the Countess Feng. \"Grandmother is the one who decided it was a good idea,\" said the old lady. \"He has a way with words,\" laughed the Countess. \"Let's give him a little money.\" The three maidservants were already preparing small wicker baskets. Hearing the \"赏\" (give some money) command, they stepped forward and scooped up the copper coins from the table and put them in the basket. Carrying it with them, they approached the stage and said, \"These are for Wenbao to buy fruit with from the old matriarch, the countess, and the madam in-law.\" They then scattered the coins on the stage, where they clattered down all over it. Jiánzhēn and Jiǎnǎn had already ordered the servants to prepare large wicker baskets to collect the coins.\n\nTo translate the text, I followed these steps:\n\n1. Understand the context and make sure I'm familiar with the cultural references. This includes knowing about the specific Chinese festival (Lantern Festival) and the drama being referenced (\"The West Tower Conference\").\n\n2. Break down the sentences into their constituent parts to identify the action, subjects, and objects. For example, when translating \"叔夜气走了\", I identified the subject (叔夜), the verb (气走了, which implies Uncle Yù left angrily), and the consequence (气, anger).\n\n3. Translate the sentences maintaining their grammatical structure as much as possible. For Chinese, this often means preserving the sentence structure, but also considering the natural flow of English in the translation.\n\n4. Use synonyms or more idiomatic expressions in English where necessary to convey the same meaning succinctly and accurately. For example, the phrase \"resourceful\" is used as a synonym for \"鬼机灵\" (qǐjīlíng) to express the child's cleverness.\n\n5. Verify that the translation maintains the meaning and tone of the original text while ensuring clarity and coherence in English. This often involves checking for consistency in tone, making sure the translation doesn't lose important details, and adjusting phrasing to improve readability.\n\n6. Proofread the translation to correct any errors or awkward phrasing, ensuring that the final text flows naturally in English and is faithful to the original Chinese text.",
