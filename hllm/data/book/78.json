The comb is broken into the shape of a dragon, and the cloud is sad. The golden flowers are scattered in the grass, and the jade box is picked up in the dust. The magpies on the roof are empty, and the seven needlesThe silk thread is thrown away, who will cut it? The ice silk is broken, the royal fragrance has not been ironed. Received an order yesterday, drove a long distance; today, I violated the imperial will and sent him back with a walking stick. I heard that the musk coffin was burned, and it was against the common grave; the stone casket was a disaster, and I was ashamed of the same ash. The ancient temple in the west wind, the Qingling lingers; the desolate tomb in the sunset, the white bones scattered. The mulberry and maple are rustling, and the wormwood is萧萧. The misty tomb crows, the smoke field ghosts. Did you think that the red silk curtain, the son's deep affection? Do you know that the yellow earth tomb, the daughter's thin life? The blood of Yuanchuan is stained in the west wind; the cold moon is silent in the Zixue. Oh! It is a disaster caused by the demon, not by the god. Destroy the bad mouth of the vulgar servant, and punish the crime. Cut the evil heart of the悍妇, and feel the anger. Although your worldly ties are shallow, and my contempt is deep. BecauseTherefore, it is a great good to believe that God has given power to man, and does not disappoint his talents. Because I hope the immortality of his soul will appear now, I have not meddled with foul words to defame the wise audience. Then I sang a dirge: \"How high is heaven, and how high is the sky? Does the jade dragon fly in the sky? How wide is the earth, and how wide is the land? Does the white elephant drive on the ground? I see the splendid canopy, is it the brilliance of the tail of the gourd? The feathered canopy is in front, and the star of the sky is guarded. Is the cloud the protection of the celestial cloud? The moon shines and the moon shines. I hear the creaking of the axle, and the phoenix is driving the chariot. I smell the fragrance, and it is made of the incense of the jujube and the jujube. The colorful skirt is the moonlight. The cattails are made of flowers and flames, and the lamps are made of orchids. The melons are used as wine vessels, and the wine is long and endless. I was abandoned in the dust. Please help me driveYou have already been buried in peace, is it the change of fate? Since you are buried, where are you going? I am still bound and cannot leave. Can you come to pick me up? If the hongmeng lives in a quiet place, even if I am here, I cannot see them. Pick smoky loo as a barrier, arrange cangpu as soldiers. Wake up the greedy eyes of willow trees, taste the bitterness of lotus. Go to Guiyan to meet Su Nv, meet Fulie at Lanzu. Erhu plays, Han Xiang hits the gu. Summon the princess of Song mountain, open the old lady of Li mountain. Tortoise presents the strange things of Luo Pu, animal performs the dance of Xianchi. Dive into the red water, the dragon's voice rises, the phoenix spreads its wings. Guard your sincerity, not a simple and rude. Depart from the Xiacity, return to the Xuanpu. Microscopic and hidden, hazy and hidden. The clouds and smoke are缭绕，雾雨朦胧。尘埃散去，星光高悬，溪山秀丽，月色正午。我的心怦怦直我感到悲伤和失落，哭泣着徘徊。没有人Pray for the departed, complete the ritual and seek peace. Alas, may you rest in peace!\n\n在这个改写过程中，我使用了现代的词汇和语法，使文本更易于理解。同时，我保留了原诗的韵律和情感，以保持其诗意和美感。",
            "chinese": "今天是太平盛世的元年，桂花和芙蓉竞相开放的月份，没有遗憾的那一天。怡红院的浊玉，以群花的花蕊、冰鲛的纱巾、沁芳的泉水、枫露的茶水，－－虽然微不足道，但聊以表达诚意和信任－－祭奠在白帝宫中抚司秋艳芙蓉女儿的面前。我思考女儿来到人世，到现在已经十六年了。她的故乡和姓氏，已经湮没而不能考证很久了。而我却在睡觉、梳洗、吃饭、玩乐的时候，和她亲密无间，相处了五年八个月有零。回忆起你过去的岁月：你的品质，金玉无法比喻其高贵；你的体态，冰雪无法比喻其纯洁。你的精神，星辰和太阳无法比喻其精纯；你的容貌，花和月亮无法比喻其美丽。姐妹们都羡慕你的纯洁，老人们都仰慕你的智慧品德。谁料到，乌鸦和鹰隼嫉妒你的高傲，鹰隼反而被罗网捕获；杂草妒忌你的芳香，兰草最终被剪除。花原本就娇弱，怎能经受狂风暴雨？“谣言诽谤，出自屏帷；荆棘蓬草，蔓延户牖。内心苦闷无限，却无法摆脱。高傲标榜，闺阁之恨比“长沙”；贞烈遭难，巾帼惨于“雁塞”。自我压抑，谁会怜惜夭折？仙云已散，芳趾难寻。洲迷聚窟，何来却死之香？海失灵槎，不获回生之药。眉黛烟青，昨犹我画；指环玉冷，今倩谁温？鼎炉之剩药犹存，襟泪之馀痕尚渍。镜分鸾影，愁开麝月之奁；梳化龙飞，哀折檀云之齿。委金钿于草莽，拾翠盒于尘埃。楼空鳷鹊，从悬七夕之针；带断鸳鸯，谁续五丝之缕？况乃金天属节，白帝司时，孤衾有梦，空室无人。桐阶月暗，芳魂与倩影同消；蓉帐香残，娇喘共细腰俱绝。连天衰草，岂独蒹葭？匝藏在屏风后面，莲瓣无声；斗草的庭院前，兰芳枉待。绣线扔了，谁会裁？冰丝折断了，御香未熨。昨天接到命令，驾车远行；今天犯了慈威，拄杖遣返。听说蕙棺被烧，违背了共穴之情；石椁成灾，愧对同灰之诮。西风古寺，青磷滞留；落日荒邱，白骨零星。楸榆飒飒，蓬艾萧萧。隔雾圹啼猿，绕烟塍泣鬼。难道红绡帐里，公子情深？才知黄土陇中，女儿命薄！汝南斑斑泪血，洒向西风；梓泽默默余衷，诉凭冷月。呜呼！固鬼蜮之为灾，岂神灵之有妒？毁诐奴之口，讨岂从宽？剖悍妇之心，忿犹未释！在卿之尘缘虽浅，而玉之鄙意尤深。因蓄惓惓之思，不禁谆谆之问。始知上帝垂旌，花宫待诏，生侪兰蕙，死为什么？以前叶法善摄魂写碑，李长吉被诏写记，虽然事情不同，但是道理是一样的。所以用适合的人来配对才气，如果不是这样的人，那么事情就很难办了。所以相信上帝把权力托付给人，真是至善至美，不辜负所赋予的才能。因为希望他们的不灭的灵魂，或者在现在出现，所以我没有揣测卑鄙的词，污蔑了智慧的听众。于是唱着招魂曲说：天怎么这么苍苍啊，乘着玉虬在天上飞吗？地怎么这么茫茫啊，驾着瑶象在地下吗？看到伞盖这么华丽啊，是不是箕尾星的光芒啊？排着羽葆作为前导啊，护卫着危虚星啊？驱使丰隆作为庇护啊，望舒月来照啊？听到车轴声啊，御驾着鸾鷖啊？闻到香气啊，是用蘅杜做佩饰啊？斑斓的裙裾啊，是不是用明月做首饰啊？用葳蕤来做成坛庙啊，擎着莲花火焰照着兰膏啊？文瓠瓟做酒器啊，洒漫长而无边无际，我被抛弃在尘埃中了吗？请风廉帮助我驾驶车辆，希望我们能并肩同行回家。我内心为之慨叹，却只能独自哭泣。你已经安然长眠，难道是天命的变化？既然已经安葬，你又会去哪里呢？我仍然被束缚，无法离开。你是否能来接我？如果鸿蒙居住在寂静的地方，即使我在这里，我也看不到他们。采撷烟萝作为屏障，排列苍蒲形成士兵。警醒柳树贪睡的眼睛，品尝莲花的苦味。在桂岩与素女约会，在兰渚迎接宓妃。弄玉吹笙，寒簧击敔。召唤嵩岳的妃子，开启骊山的姥姥。龟呈现洛浦的灵异，兽表演咸池的舞蹈。潜入赤水，龙吟声响起，凤凰展翅飞翔。格守诚心，不是简单粗暴。从霞城出发，回到玄圃。显微若隐若现，氤氲若隐若现。云烟缭绕，雾雨蒙蒙。尘埃散去，星光高悬，溪山秀丽，月色正午。我的心怦怦直我感到悲伤和失落，哭泣着徘徊。没有人说话，只有风声和鸟鸣。鸟儿惊恐地飞走，鱼儿发出响声。为纪念逝者而祷告，完成仪式期待祥和。呜呼哀哉！尚飨！\n\n在这个改写过程中，我使用了现代的词汇和语法，使文本更易于理解。同时，我保留了原诗的韵律和情感，以保持其诗意和美感。"
