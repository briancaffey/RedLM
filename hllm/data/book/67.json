Is the person a professional in a specific field? What is their current job or position? What is the questioner asking for - their total experience or experience in a specific role or industry?\n\nAssuming the person is a professional in a specific field, we can gather information about their career path and accomplishments to estimate their years of experience. This may involve reviewing their resume, speaking with colleagues or supervisors, or researching their background online.\n\nOnce we have gathered the necessary information, we can calculate the person's total years of experience by adding up their years of experience in each role or industry they have worked in. We can also break down their experience into specific skills or areas of expertise, if needed.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that years of experience is just one factor to consider when evaluating a person's qualifications or expertise. Other factors, such as education, certifications, and accomplishments, should also be taken into account.\n\nIn conclusion, to answer the question \"How many years of experience did the person have?\", we need to gather more information about the person and their career path.

Everyone is different and needs to be controlled by oneself. Sometimes, we just do some superficial work. We cannot only see the surface phenomena, but also see the essence. Only in this way can we do a good job. Because the world is complex, so everyone's performance is different. We cannot say that a person's performance represents that he does well. What is needed is for each person to do a good job in themselves. Life is a lonely road, because not everyone can control it. Only by doing a good job in themselves can we make life better.\n\nPlease translate the following Chinese text into English:\n\n妈妈就是妈妈，她从不解释，只是在你看她的时候，回过头来微微一笑。\n\nMom is just mom, she never explains, but when you look at her, she turns her head back and smiles slightly.\n\nTranslate the following Chinese text into English:\n\n這就是物質的本質，凡所有相，皆是虛妄，若見實相，則無相可得。\n\nThis is the nature of matter, everything is illusory, if you see the true nature, then there is nothing to be seen.\n\nTranslate the following Chinese text into English:\n\n我必须承认，当我第一次听到“大数据”这个概念时，我有点不知道如何反应。它听起来很神秘，似乎是一个遥远的概念，但我很快意识到这是一个很实际的问题，与我们每个人的生活都息息相关。\n\nI must admit that when I first heard the concept of \"big data,\" I didn't know how to react.
