It's possible that older servants who are aware of adult affairs might not be able to keep up with their inquiries and might sneak out. Alternatively, they might use an excuse to chat with the young boys from the second gate: it's not impossible that they got them from outside. Not only have I not done this, but even if Ping'er, I can also swear to that. Please think it over carefully, Madam.\n\nIn this translation, I have aimed to preserve the original meaning while making it more natural and fluent in English. The text discusses the possibility of several scenarios involving servants in the garden and how they could be involved in inappropriate activities. The speaker insists on their innocence and even extends this assurance to the character of Ping'er, stating that they can also swear to it. The speaker also suggests that Madam should consider these possibilities.而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉知不是他们的？\n\n而且园内丫头也多，保不住都是正经的。或者年纪大些的，知道了人事，一刻查问不到，偷出去了；或借着因由，合二门上小么儿们打牙撂嘴儿：外头得了来的，也未可知。不但我没此事，就连平儿，我也可以下保的。太太请细想！\n\n还有那边珍大嫂子，他也不算很老，也常带过佩凤他们来，又焉太太请细想！”\n\n此外，园内仆人数量众多，保不住每个都是老实的。或者有年纪较大的，知晓人事，一旦查问不到，可能偷偷溜出去；或者借着理由，与二门上的小厮们打嘴仗：外头有人送来的，也有可能。除了我没有这样的事，就连平儿，我也能担保。太太请仔细考虑！\n\nThen, there is the servant girl, who is also very handsome, but not as beautiful as the other servant girl. Her father is a wealthy merchant who is in charge of the sales of silk and other luxury goods. He has many properties and is very well-off. He is very fond of his daughter and treats her like a princess. He hopes that she will find a good husband someday.\n\nHowever, the servant girl is not interested in marriage. She loves to sing and dance and is very skilled at it. She spends most of her time practicing her singing and dancing, and she is very popular among the other servants. They all love to listen to her sing and watch her dance.\n\nThe young master is very interested in the servant girl. He is also very talented in music and singing. He is attracted to her beauty and her talent. He often sings and dances with her and they have a very good time together.\n\nOne day, the young master and the servant girl went out to a party. They were both very happy and enjoyed themselves. However, they were discovered by the other servants and were forced to leave the party. The young master was very angry and he vowed to get revenge on the other servants.\n\nHe waited until the other servants were asleep and then he went to their rooms one by one. He broke into each room and took all their money and jewels. He also destroyed their furniture and belongings. The servants were very angry and they went to the young master's father to complain.\n\nThe young master's father was very angry and he punished his son severely. He beat him and locked him in his room for a month. The young master was very sorry for what he had done and he promised to never do it again.\n\nHe went to the servant girl's father and asked for her hand in marriage. The father was very happy and he agreed to the marriage. The young master and the servant girl were married and they lived happily ever after.\n\nThe end.Translation:\n\nNot only have I not done this, even if Ping'er, I can also give it a guarantee. Madam, please think about it carefully!\n\nAlso, the auntie on the other side, she's not that old either, and she often brings Pei Feng and others with her, so how do we know it's not them? Moreover, there are many maidservants in the garden, and it's not guaranteed that they are all honest. Maybe the older ones, who know about human affairs, can't be checked and go out at any time; or they take advantage of the opportunity, talk with the little servants on the second floor, and outside, they also don't know.

Consider the map $\\pi: S^1/\\sim \\to T^2$ defined as follows:\n\n1. Choose a basepoint $p$ in $T^2$.\n2. For each point $x$ in $S^1/\\sim$, map it to the point in $T^2$ that is obtained by rotating $p$ by an angle $\\theta$ such that $\\pi(\\theta) = x$, where $\\pi: \\mathbb{R} \\to S^1/\\sim$ is the natural projection.\n\nThis map is well-defined because $S^1/\\sim$ is a quotient space, and the equivalence relation $\\sim$ is compatible with the group action of $\\mathbb{R}$ on $S^1$. Moreover, $\\pi$ is a covering space map because it is a local homeomorphism and the preimage of any point in $T^2$ is a discrete set.\n\nTo show that $\\pi$ is a homeomorphism, we need to show that it is surjective and that its inverse is continuous. The surjectivity of $\\pi$ follows from the fact that every point in $T^2$ can be obtained by rotating $p$ by some angle. The continuity of the inverse map follows from the fact that the projection $\\pi$ is a covering space map.\n\nTherefore, $\\pi$ is a homeomorphism between $S^1/\\sim$ and $T^2$, which proves that these two spaces are homeomorphic.\n\nConsider the following set of 100 observations of \\( X \\) and 100 observations of \\( Y \\):\n\n| X | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Y | 2 | 4 | 3 | 6 | 7 | 4 | 8 | 2 | 6 | 7 |\n\na.

The test statistic \\( t \\) is:\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{r\\sqrt{n-2}}{\\sqrt{1-r^2}} \\]\n\nWith \\( n = 100 \\):\n\n\\[ t = \\frac{0.999999999\\sqrt{100-2}}{\\sqrt{1-0.999999999^2}} \\]\n\\[ t \\approx 2.872756937 \\]\n\nThe degrees of freedom \\( df \\) are \\( n - 2 = 98 \\).
