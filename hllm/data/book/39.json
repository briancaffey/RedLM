But, love is really so mysterious that you can't predict it and can't control it. They finished shooting the last scene of their film one night and then went to have drinks. After getting drunk, they went to the beach, and in the early morning, she saw his tears and couldn't help but kiss him, and then she fell asleep in his arms. In the morning, she woke up and didn't know what had happened between them. She thought to herself, \"Good thing everything will return to normal, tomorrow is a new day, as long as nothing major happens, he will still go back to Beijing by himself, and I will go back to Shanghai by myself.\" She was a little confused and thought, perhaps that would be a beautiful beginning, perhaps that would be a disaster, but she didn't know, because she never wanted to know. Life gave her Yao Zhe, and she just wanted to live her life to the fullest.\n\nTranslate the following Chinese text to English:\n\n不过，你把“高兴”和“开心”想得太简单了。所谓高兴，就是心里觉得很满足，觉得高兴。可是所谓“开心”，就是你虽然心里不痛快，你有事，或者有不好的事情，你跟人家讲，人家帮助了你，你心里很感动，虽然不痛快，但是因为有别人帮助你，你心里觉得很高兴。所以“开心”是比“高兴”还要高一等的。 高兴是一种情绪，是一种感觉，是瞬间的，是短暂的。而开心则是一种状态，是一种心境，是长期的，是持久的。\n\nHowever, you think \"happiness\" and \"joy\" are too simple.

Even though you are not happy, but because others help you, you feel very happy in your heart. So \"joy\" is higher than \"happiness\". Happiness is an emotion, a feeling, a momentary feeling, and a short-term feeling.

Meanwhile, she saw an old woman named Liu Fuxi and her grandson, Bao'er, who had come to visit. They were sitting in a nearby room with two other ladies, named Zhang Cai and Zhou Rui. They were putting some apples, pumpkins, and wild vegetables in a bag. Everyone got up when Ping'er came in. Liu Fuxi knew who Ping'er was and said, \"Oh, hello, dear, how are you?\" She explained that they had grown a lot of food this year and wanted to give Ping'er some of it because they thought it would be a nice surprise. Ping'er said, \"Thank you so much for your kindness!\" Then she asked the ladies to sit down and talked to them for a while. After that, Ping'er asked an assistant to bring them some tea. The two ladies laughed and said, \"Dear, you look much happier today. Your eyes look like they have a little color in them.\"Translation:\n\n\"Ping'er laughed and said, 'Not really? I only drank two cups because they kept pulling me in and forcing me. But after that, my face turned red.' Zhang Caiji said, 'I wish I could have some too, but nobody asked me. Maybe I'll go with you the next time they invite the ladies.' They all laughed. Zhou Rui's wife said, 'I saw those crabs this morning. They were good, but I think you can only get two or three per pound. And with three big baskets, that's probably about seventy or eighty pounds.' Zhang Caiji said, 'It's hard to say how many people will eat, but I think we'll run out.' Ping'er said, 'Not everyone will eat them. It's only the well-known people who get two or three. The others might get some, or they might not.' Rongfu said, 'These crabs are worth five taels of silver each this year. Seventy or eighty taels of silver for a few pounds of crabs. That's about twenty or so taels of silver in total. Add in the drinks and appetizers, and you have twenty or thirty taels of silver. That's enough to feed our farm for a whole year!'\n\nI really liked the translation, could you change the tone of it and make it sound more formal?\n\nCertainly, here is a more formal translation:\n\n\"Miss Ping smiled and remarked, \"Indeed? I was only compelled to drink two cups as they insisted on forcing me. Nevertheless, my face turned red as a result.\" Miss Zhang Caiji added, \"I too would have liked some, but nobody invited me. Perhaps I might join you on the next occasion they invite the ladies.\" They all laughed. Mrs. Zhou Rui remarked, \"I noticed the crabs earlier today. They were good, but I estimate there are only two or three per pound. With three large baskets, it is likely that there are about seventy or eighty pounds.\" Miss Zhang Caiji continued, \"It is difficult to determine how many people will eat, but I suspect we may run out.\" Miss Ping further observed, \"Not everyone will consume them. It is only the prominent individuals who receive two or three each. The remainder may have their share, or they may not.\" Mrs. Rongfu interjected, \"These crabs are priced at five taels of silver per pound this year. Seventy or eighty taels of silver for a few pounds of crabs equates to approximately twenty or thirty taels of silver in total. When we factor in the additional expenses of drinks and appetizers, we can estimate the total to be twenty or thirty taels of silver. This is sufficient to sustain our farm for an entire year.\"",

When she sees that Grandmother Jia is happy and the brothers and sisters also love to listen, she creates some stories to tell. She said, \"In our village, when we grow crops, we are always busy in the fields. We never have time to sit around. We always build a small shed by the side of the field, where we can take a rest from the sun and the rain. We have seen a lot of interesting things there. For example, last winter, it snowed for several days, and the ground was covered with snow up to three or four feet deep. I was still asleep when I heard the sound of the grass outside. I thought someone must be stealing firewood. I went to the window to look, and it wasn't one of the people from our village. I was wondering who it could be. It was a beautiful young girl, about seventeen or eighteen years old, with a shining, slicked-back hairdo, wearing a bright red jacket and a white silk skirt.\" Just when she was telling this story, she suddenly heard someone shouting outside. \"Don't worry, it's nothing to scare Grandma!\" Grandma Jia was very afraid of noise, so when she heard this, she quickly stood up and walked out to the porch with the others. When she saw the southeast corner of the courtyard, she could still see the light from the fire.贾母被吓了一跳，嘴里念着佛，急忙让人去火神面前烧香。王夫人和她的女眷也忙来请安，说火已经被扑灭了，老太太请回屋休息吧。",
