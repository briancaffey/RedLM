It is acceptable when it enhances the clarity of the text or supports the argument being made. However, excessive repetition for no apparent reason may be seen as a stylistic flaw rather than plagiarism. In the given sentence, the repetition of \"宝玉\" and \"黛玉\" serves to emphasize the characters and maintain continuity in addressing them throughout the passage. This is not an instance of plagiarism because the repetition is not due to copying but rather to stylistic choice and narrative focus.

Virtues are something inherent in human nature, but people often fail to value them. As for desires, although they are also innate, everyone likes them, but virtues are part of the natural order, while desires are part of human nature. How could people value the natural order as much as they value desires? The Sage's sighing is actually a reflection of his expectations for others. He sees that people do seek virtues, but this liking is superficial. Only by valuing virtues as much as desires is one truly good.\" Dai Ruo said, \"That makes sense. Let me ask you this: if you understand the Sage's words, why do you still commit these two flaws? In fact, I've known about your flaws for a long time. As a person, you should constantly strive to improve. Now is the time when you should be considered formidable. There's no need to fear hearing something new; it all depends on your own practice. I'll give you a month to clear up your old books. In another month, you'll learn to write articles. If you don't work hard, I won't listen to you. It's true that 'adults are not free, and freedom does not make one adult' in ancient times. Remember my words.\" Bai Yu agreed and had no choice but to work hard on his studies.

Holding her sewing tools, she reminisced about how with Bao Yuyu now having his studies to worry about, there was no longer a need for the maids to fuss over him. Had she known this, she wouldn't have allowed Qiong-wen to end up in such a tragic fate. As-yi couldn't help but feel sorrow for Qiong-wen's situation, and simultaneously, she began to ponder her own future. She had been Bao Yuyu's favored concubine, and she believed that Bao Yuyu's character was dependable. However, she also feared that in the event of his marrying a domineering woman, she might end up like Yu Er'nu or Xiang Ling. She had observed the actions and behaviors of Old Madam Jia, Lady Wang, and Feng Ji, and she felt that perhaps it was most likely that it would be Dai Yu, who was naturally sensitive and emotional, to end up as his wife. Thinking this, As-yi's cheeks turned red and her heart warmed. The needle and thread in her hand were unknowingly pricked. She thus laid down her work and went in search of Dai Yu, hoping to gauge her thoughts. \n\nThis simplified version maintains the essence of the original passage while adapting it to a more contemporary style of language, making it more accessible to modern readers.

At this moment, Cui Lu and Cui Mo had just returned from Daiyu, looking worried. Yun asked first, \"Why hasn't Linnuo come yet?\" Cui Lu replied, \"Linnuo was sick last night and didn't sleep a wink, coughing hard. We heard Xueyan say she had spat out a box of phlegm and blood.\" Chunyu was shocked upon hearing this: \"Is this true?\" Cui Lu responded, \"How could it be false!\" Cui Mo added, \"We just went in to see her, and she looked so weak she couldn't even muster the energy to speak.\" Yun asked, \"Can someone in such a state still talk?\" Chunyu said, \"How foolish are you! If she can't even speak, doesn't that mean she's in serious condition?\" She was unable to continue her sentence. Xuan said, \"Sister Daiyu is so intelligent, I think she takes things too seriously and takes them too literally. What can be real in the world?\" Chunyu said, \"Since it's like that, let's all go see her first. If her condition is severe, we'll tell the headwoman and then inform the old lady, sending someone to summon a doctor for diagnosis and treatment.\" Yun said, \"That's what we should do.\" Xuan said, \"Let the sisters go first. I'll come back later.\"",
