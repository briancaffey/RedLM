Besides, those old history books, there are always things that can criticize the emperors and ministers, criticize people's wives and daughters, or be evil and vicious, and so on, which are the easiest to damage children.

What is even worse is \"this\" \"that\" \"the\" \"is\" \"is not\", such language, if it does not make sense, is literature, and it is not in line with reality and self-contradictory. It is better than my whole life has witnessed several women, although I dare not say that they are better than the women of previous generations, but by looking at their stories and causes, it can also dispel sorrow and melancholy. As for a few crooked poems, they can be used as dishes for wine. Among them, the ups and downs of separation and reunion, the rise and fall of fate, are written in the order of fact, without too much modification, in order to preserve the authenticity.
