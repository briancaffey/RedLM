Lady Bao knew that her brother was going to take the tests, so she was concerned about two things. The first was that they were all novices and that there would be a large number of people around, causing confusion and perhaps even danger. The second was that since the monk left, her brother had been staying at home, and although he seemed to be working hard, she found it worrying that he was changing too quickly and too well. Therefore, the night before the tests, Lady Bao arranged for Xisi to take care of the servants and Shusun to make sure everything was ready. She then personally checked everything and placed it safely away, preparing for the next day. Next, Lady Bao went to tell Liwan that she wanted several experienced staff from the household to be present, in case of any accidents or mishaps.",
