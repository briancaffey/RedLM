On the day before Jia Baoyu was to leave, Bao Jiaochao made sure that his aunt and uncle were well taken care of by her maids, Xusunyun, and the others, and that their belongings were in good order. She then went over to visit Lady Li and asked her to send some experienced servants to look after them, asking Lady Li to assign more servants to make sure they were not disturbed. She was worried that Jia Baoyu might run into some trouble, given that this was his first time taking the examination, and that he might not have left the temple very often since he had parted ways with the monk. Despite his efforts, she was still concerned that the improvements in his studies might have come too quickly, and that they might be sudden, causing her to worry that something might happen again.
