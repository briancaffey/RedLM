            "english": "After Ping'er came out, she instructed the Lady Lin to pass on that it was the mark of a successful household for a matter of magnitude to be reduced to a minor affair and a minor affair to become one of no significance. To be shocked and alarmed at a small matter and to create commotion was simply not in order. Now that the mother and daughter had been brought back, they were to be put back to work as before, and the Lady Qin's retinue recalled, this matter should not be mentioned again. All that was necessary was to be vigilant in their duties. Then she got up and left. Lady Liu's mother and daughter quickly prostrated themselves in gratitude. The Lady Lin returned to inform Lady Li and Lady Lin, who said that they had been informed and that it would be best if there were no trouble.\n\nThe next day, Lady Wang came to visit Lady Li. Lady Wang said, \"I've heard that Lady Lin is expecting a grandchild. I came to offer my congratulations in advance.\" Lady Li said, \"That's right, Lady Wang. But I hope it won't be too long before you return home to your family.\" Lady Wang laughed and said, \"Don't worry about me, Lady Li. I have my own reasons for coming here, and I'm not planning on staying long. I'm just here to see you, as a friend.\"\n\nLady Wang then turned to talk to Lady Lin, who was busy preparing for her upcoming pregnancy. She said, \"Lady Lin, you must take good care of yourself during your pregnancy. Don't worry too much about household duties, as that can be tiring for you. Just relax and enjoy the anticipation of your new addition to the family.\"\n\nLady Lin thanked Lady Wang for her concern and promised to take good care of herself. The two ladies then had a pleasant conversation about the joys and challenges of family life before parting ways.\n\nThe next day, Lady Wang went to see Lady Lin and her family. As she entered the house, she was greeted by the sweet scent of freshly baked bread and the sound of happy laughter. Lady Wang was immediately put at ease and felt a sense of warmth and belonging in this home.\n\nShe found Lady Lin in the kitchen, overseeing the preparations for a family meal. Lady Wang was touched by the care and attention that Lady Lin was giving to each dish, and she praised her for her skills as a homemaker. Lady Lin, in turn, thanked Lady Wang for her kind words and shared some of the traditional recipes she had learned from her mother.\n\nDuring their conversation, Lady Wang noticed the young child playing nearby. She asked about the child's name and learned that he was Lady Lin's son, Xiangyi. She was delighted to see how happy and healthy he was, and she asked Lady Lin for advice on how to raise a child.\n\nLady Wang also spent some time with Lady Wang's mother, who was a kind and wise woman. She listened to her stories about the past and gained valuable insights into the history and culture of the family. Lady Wang left the house feeling enriched by the experience and grateful for the hospitality shown to her.\n\nIn the days that followed, Lady Wang returned to her own home, but her thoughts were filled with the memories of her visit to Lady Lin's family. She appreciated the warmth and connection she had felt during her stay, and she looked forward to the possibility of more visits in the future.\n\nAs for Lady Lin, she continued to prepare for the arrival of her grandchild with excitement and anticipation. She enjoyed the support and company of her family and friends, including Lady Wang, who remained a cherished guest in her home.\n\nTogether, they faced the challenges of family life with love, laughter, and the deep bonds of friendship, creating cherished memories that would last a lifetime.",

She had originally gone there to escape the summer heat, but without realizing it she had been forced to drink two extra cups of wine, and her weak body could no longer take it, so she fell asleep. She felt a little regretful as she thought about it. A little girl had already brought a basin of water for her to wash her face. There were two other girls holding a mirror case. Everyone was waiting for her. She got up from the stone steps and washed her face again and put her hair in place, then hurriedly got up and went to the Red Fragrance Garden with them. They drank two more cups of strong tea. When Zhentian rushed forward, she told him to bring her a piece of stone to chew on, to help sober her up. Then she drank some sour soup and felt a little better. After that, she chose a few fruits and dishes to take to Fengzhi. Fengzhi sent a few things over as well.\n\nThe translations by Xu Yuanchong, which is the only one I've been able to find online, uses a word I don't know the meaning of: \"醒酒石\" -- \"stone to sober up.\" Does anyone know what it means?\n\nIt seems to refer to a stone that is chewed on to sober up, so it is also translated as \"Drinking stone.\" In Chinese traditional medicine, it is said that there are certain stones or minerals that can help one sober up after drinking too much alcohol. People might chew on them or drink a tea made from them to help relieve the effects of alcohol intoxication. The name \"醒酒石\" translates to \"stone to sober up\" or \"drinking stone\" in English.\n\nInteresting, I've never heard of using stones to sober up before. I wonder how effective it really is, considering modern medicine has different methods for dealing with alcohol intoxication. It would be fascinating to learn more about traditional Chinese practices like this.\n\nYes, indeed! Traditional Chinese practices often have rich histories and deep cultural significance. As for the effectiveness of the \"醒酒石\", it's a matter of debate. Some people believe in its traditional medicinal properties, while others might find it more effective for its placebo effect. The belief in these practices can stem from cultural tradition and personal experiences. However, when it comes to medical conditions, the science behind them should be thoroughly understood, and where necessary, modern medicine should be utilized. In the case of alcohol intoxication, there are well-established methods in modern medicine such as drinking water, resting, eating food, and if needed, receiving medical assistance. The use of \"醒酒石\" or any other traditional practices should be considered in conjunction with, not as a replacement for, these established medical methods. Always consult a healthcare professional for advice on medical matters. \n\nUnderstanding and appreciating traditional practices can provide insight into the cultural context and historical background of these methods, which in turn can enrich our understanding of human health and wellbeing. This is why exploring and learning about such practices can be fascinating and valuable. \n\nWould you like to know more about traditional Chinese practices in any specific area, or would you like to discuss another topic?
