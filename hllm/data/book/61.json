            "english": "Translated text:\n\nThis Liu family woman heard this little one's words and laughed, saying, \"A clever monkey kid! Your auntie found a man in the wild, so you got another uncle, right? What are you worried about? Don't let me pull your mat cap off! Hurry up and open the door so I can come in!\" The little servant didn't open the door right away and instead pulled her by the hand and laughed, \"Oh auntie, when you go in, please steal a few peaches for me to eat. I'm waiting here. If you forget, then when it's late at night and you need to buy wine or oil, I won't open the door for you or respond to you, and you can just shout. But this year is different from the past few years. We've already divided all the fruit among the other maids. They're all like those wild chickens that have pecked their faces. What's the point of stealing fruit from them? Besides, your aunt and my aunt are your relatives, so why don't you ask them for some, instead of asking me? That's like 'the mouse asks the crow for grain, and the one staying has none, while the one flying does.'\"\n\n小厮又道：“好婶子，我可是你老人家的猴儿孙子，你怎么好不爱我呢？我给你老人家磕头，把这门扇子都磕折了，你就可怜可怜我，偷个儿儿儿儿……”说不了，便哽咽起来。柳氏道：“你这猴儿崽子！还说呢，我给你买了几串冰糖，你平白的说，我有好东西，就偷。我就是拿刀子杀你，你也不敢动我一根头发，你还偷？”小厮笑道：“怎么敢呢？我吃了亏也就罢了，谁还敢馋你老人家的？我说的是前儿我带了果子送给那个小老婆吃，那小老婆接了果子，我等着他赏我钱，他倒骂了我一顿，又把我手里的果子都打了，剩了这么个半个的。”柳氏道：“他打你就罢了，怎么还骂你？又打了你？难道你没惹着他？到底为什么？”小厮道：“他嫌我手里的东西不好，才打了我。”柳氏听了这话，便笑起来，说：“怎么样，我早知道你没惹着她。你既说她不喜你送的果子，你来告诉我，我再送她一箱。我不用那养小叔子的小老婆，我有亲生的儿子呢。他有什么好的？他也不知要多少呢！他有什么好的？他也不知要多少呢！”小厮笑道：“婶子，你怎么知道他不要呢？我听见他母亲说，他好几天不吃饭了。”柳氏道：“我不信。他有什么好东西？我都没给他，他怎么能不要？他要要到什么了，也不告诉我一声，我还要打他一顿呢！”\n\nThe little servant continued, \"Oh auntie, I'm your monkey grandson, and you shouldn't not love me. I'll bow to you and break this door. Please have pity on me and steal a few peaches for me to eat.\" He couldn't finish his sentence and began to sob. Liu Family Woman said, \"You naughty monkey! What are you saying? I bought you some sugarcane, and you just said I have good things, so you want to steal them. If I kill you with a knife, you wouldn't even dare to touch my hair, and yet you still want to steal?\" The little servant laughed, \"How could I? I'd just take my loss, but I wouldn't dare to envy you. The other day, I brought some fruit to that little mistress, and she took it from me. I was waiting for her to give me some money, but she just scolded me and threw my fruit away, leaving me with just a half.\" Liu Family Woman said, \"She threw your fruit away and scolded you? That's terrible! Did you do something to her? Why did she do that?\" The little servant replied, \"She didn't like the fruit I gave her, so she threw it away and scolded me.\" Liu Family Woman laughed, \"Well, I knew you didn't do anything to her. You said she didn't like the fruit you gave her, so tell me, and I'll send her a whole box. I don't need that mistress who's keeping my nephew as her lover, I have my own son. He doesn't have anything good. He wouldn't even know what to do with it. He doesn't have anything good. He wouldn't even know what to do with it.\" The little servant laughed, \"Auntie, how do you know he doesn't want it? I heard his mother say he hasn't eaten for days.\" Liu Family Woman said, \"I don't believe it. He doesn't have anything good. I haven't given him anything, and he wouldn't want it. If he does want something, he won't tell me, and I'll beat him up.\"\n\n小厮听他母亲如此说，也笑道：“嗳哟！我原来还怕你老人家不许我偷呢！既如此，我就请受婶子的福了！”遂往里走。柳氏笑道：“猴儿崽子，你这小鬼头儿，你也打发我呢！”一面说着，一面找果子。小厮道：“婶子，我送你几个罢。前儿我送他家的那个小老婆，他家的老婆打发人来问我要果子，要了我好些呢。我原想留几个等你老人家来的，忘了。”柳氏道：“这都是外人，这等不叫人知道。”小厮笑道：“你老人家怕人知道，怎么我就不怕？他家里人问我，我就说，'这是你婶子给的。'”柳氏道：“这么着，你且带着我瞧去，我好叫他家的人知道。”小厮笑道：“婶子，你老人家是好人，我是乖人。你放心，我只顾吃，再不提人。”说着，便去拨弄那点心匣子，那匣子里的点心本来不多，一拨弄，便都倒在地上了。小厮又叫来两个老婆子，把地上的点心捡了收起来。柳氏道：“这可好了！他怎么好意思要呢？”小厮笑道：“婶子，你老人家别管，我们只顾吃，再不提人。”柳氏道：“猴儿崽子，你好大胆子！敢在你婶子面前打趣我！”小厮笑道：“你老人家还说呢，我若说他家的人怎么着，你又叫我别提人了。”柳氏道：“那也罢了，你且吃你的。可别招他家的人知道，就叫你白吃一顿，到头来还是没好处。”小厮笑道：“这有什么好处呢？他家的人知道，难道敢来抢我的不成？”柳氏道：“怎么不抢你的？前儿人家打发人来，你没给他们东西，他倒说你送他家的小老婆去了。你猜他怎么说？他说，'你这小鬼头儿，你还敢来撒谎！你送他家的小老婆去了，叫我们拿刀子来杀你。'”小厮听了，也笑道：“他也不敢来抢我。他家那小老婆，我给他送了去，他倒骂了我一顿，还打了我。他就是敢来抢，我也不怕他。”柳氏道：“你这猴儿崽子，也不知作过多少孽了，还敢说这种话！你还不磕头去，替你赎罪呢！”小厮道：“赎什么罪？你老人家自己吃了亏，又罚我。这都是谁的不是？这还了得！”\n\nThe little servant heard his mother say this and laughed, \"Oh! I was afraid you wouldn't let me steal! If you do, I'll accept your blessings!\" So he went inside. Liu Family Woman laughed, \"Naughty monkey, you little devil, you're making fun of me too!\" As they spoke, they looked for some fruit. The little servant said, \"Auntie, let me give you some. The other day, when I brought fruit to that little mistress, her husband's mistress sent someone to ask for some fruit, and they took quite a bit. I wanted to save some for you, but I forgot.\" Liu Family Woman said, \"These are outsiders, so we shouldn't let anyone know.\" The little servant laughed, \"You're afraid others will know, but I'm not. If they ask me, I'll say, 'This is from your aunt.'\"\n\nLiu Family Woman said, \"Okay, let's go show them so they know.\" The little servant laughed, \"Auntie, you're a good person, and I'm a clever person. You can trust me. I'll eat, but I won't mention anyone.\" So he started to play with the box of snacks. The snacks weren't much to begin with, and when he started messing with them, they all fell to the ground. He called for two servants to pick up the snacks and put them away. Liu Family Woman said, \"That's great! How could he ask for it?\" The little servant laughed, \"Auntie, don't worry, just eat and don't mention anyone.\" Liu Family Woman said, \"You naughty monkey, you're so bold! You're making fun of me\"My sister has a good place, and the days she will call us are many, so we can agree to her wishes more often,\" Cui Shu said. Cui Li heard this and said, \"You're being naughty again, monkey. What good place does my sister have?\"\n\nBriefly summarize this sentence: mideast leaders have called for the international community to take action against israel 's military operations in the gaza strip , saying the continued bloodshed must be put to an end .\n\nMideast leaders have asked world leaders to stop Israel's fighting in Gaza and make it stop killing people.",
