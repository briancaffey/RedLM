Once that happens, they will become even bolder and disregard all rules.\" They all laughed and said, \"That's right, it's also the way you've left room for yourself.\"\n\nThis revised sentence attempts to maintain the tone and sentence structure of ancient Chinese, using words like \"乃,\" \"始,\" \"以,\" \"谓\" etc. However, please note that there are significant differences between modern Chinese and ancient Chinese in terms of grammar and vocabulary, and translating directly into modern Chinese may involve some simplification or adjustment. In ancient Chinese prose, expressions are generally more subtle and indirect, and there are specific rules for sentence structure and paragraph organization, so translating directly may still require interpretation and flexibility.",
