            "english": "Peng Er stayed the night at Lady Li’s residence. In contrast, Wang Xifeng accompanied her grandmother. On his return that evening, he found his bedroom empty. Since he was embarrassed to wake anyone up, he fell into a disoriented sleep. The next morning, when he came to, he was upset that he had not come over last night. It was then that he realized that Lady Bing was worrying about him. She had come over early in the morning, with instructions from Lady Xing to bring Jia Lian over to his grandmother. He had no choice but to carry out her wishes, so he went over and knelt before his grandmother. She asked, “What’s wrong?” Jia Lian quickly smiled and said, \"I was drunk last night and upset something important in the family. I came over to beg for your forgiveness.\" His grandmother spat and said, \"Lout, you’re drunk and start beating up your wife? No wonder she said you were a tyrant, you scared her to death yesterday. If it weren’t for me, you would have killed her. How are you now?\"\n\n\nShi Jia Lian's Postscript\n\nThis story seems to suggest that in ancient China, the family structure was patriarchal, placing men at the center and women in a subordinate position. Women, especially wives, were expected to endure and submit to their husbands' behavior, and their actions and decisions were often heavily influenced by the men in their lives. It also implies that women, like men, could be physically abusive, and that physical violence within the family was not uncommon. It highlights the complex dynamics of power and authority within a traditional Chinese family. The story emphasizes the role of the matriarch, who in this case is Jia Lian's grandmother, in mediating conflicts and maintaining harmony within the family. She serves as a moral guide and arbiter, demonstrating her power over her male relatives. Overall, this story provides insight into the social, cultural, and gender norms that shaped family life in ancient China.",
