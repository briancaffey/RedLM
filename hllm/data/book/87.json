Our mother gradually grew old. Hearing the eerie sounds of spirits and ghosts never ended, and we suffered through countless terrifying events, just like a storm in the wind. At night, when I tossed and turned, I could not untangle my worries! My sister and I were very close, how could I not be heartbroken for her? Looking back on the time when we joined a literary society together, it was autumn. We composed poems while admiring chrysanthemums, and it was a joyful experience. I remember the lines, \"Amidst the solitude, I revel in my own beauty, in contrast to the world. My flowers bloom, yet they are late compared to others.\" It was a time of great loneliness and high morality. Now, recalling those memories, I have penned four poems, not out of a false sense of sorrow, but to convey my grief for my sister through poetry. I lament the passing of time, and it's autumn again. I feel sorry for our family's misfortune, and being alone. What can I do for my mother, who is in the north hall? There's no way to ease her sorrow. My heart aches terribly! It's like clouds are thick and the winds are cold, with autumn winds being particularly chilly. I wander around the courtyard, as leaves fall, with nowhere to go. The past laughter is lost! In silence, my heart is like a knife being twisted! These fish dive deep into the water, while birds have full feathers. I pull my hair, wondering in this vast universe, who knows of my everlasting sorrow? The Milky Way flows quietly in the night sky, with a cool breeze. The moonlight falls斜, adding to the melancholy, and each passing second of time, I mourn aloud. I keep reciting, only seeking someone to pour out my soul to.",

There had been no need to be careful about what she said. She had had a beautiful carriage, and a beautiful boat, with red hibiscus blossoms on the poles and green curtains hanging down. She had been the most honored of all. And now she was a guest in another family. Even though there were many people to look after her, she had to be careful in all she did.

This statement is quite accurate. Since ancient times, people have always desired 'having something,' a desire that is not entirely of their own will, but rather a fundamental aspect of survival. If a person is able to transcend this natural instinct, they would attain true freedom.\" I thought, \"While this statement has merit, not everyone can understand it.

            "original": "惜春听了，默默无语。因想：“妙玉虽然洁净，毕竟尘缘未断。可惜我生在这种人家，不便出家，我若出了家时，那有邪魔缠扰！一念不生，万缘俱寂。”想到这里，蓦与神会，若有所得，便口占一偈云：",
            "english": "And alas for her virtue like a stopped clock, so to say, and her eloquent mind as white as snow!\nHer fate, like a jade sash hanging in a forest, or a gold hairpin buried in the snow.\n\nSighing, Xicun considered the words of the refined妙玉, but said nothing. She thought to herself, \"Even though she is pure, her fate is still constrained by the ways of the world. How unfortunate I am to have been born into a wealthy family, unable to escape and renounce the world. If I had renounced the world, I would not have to worry about these concerns anymore. In a state of nothingness, all worries would disappear.\" After she arrived at this realization, her spirit seemed to merge with some transcendent state, as if she had gained a new understanding. She then recited a poem:\n\nAlas, for her virtue like a stopped clock, her eloquence like snow.\nA jade sash hangs in the forest, a gold hairpin buried in snow.\n\nThis poem, by contrasting the characteristics of Xicun and the refined妙玉, expresses their regret for their respective fates and suggests the possible outcomes of their lives. \"Stopping clock\" and \"eloquent snow\" metaphorically depict the attributes of妙玉 and Xicun, while \"hanging jade sash in the forest\" and \"buried gold hairpin in snow\" allude to their potential future situations, hinting at the tragic implications of their destinies.",
            "chinese": "可叹停机德，堪怜咏絮才。\n\n玉带林中挂，金簪雪里埋。\n惜春听了妙玉的话后，没有说话。因为她想到：“妙玉虽然很纯洁，可她的命运还是不能摆脱世俗的束缚。可怜我生在富贵人家，不能出家修行。如果我出家了，那些烦心事就不会再来打扰我了。在没有任何杂念的状态下，所有的烦恼都会消失。”想到这里，她的精神仿佛与某种超然的状态相融合，恍然有所领悟，于是她吟诵了一首诗：\n\n可叹她具有像停机的德行，值得怜悯的是她拥有如飞雪般才华的才能。\n\n像玉带一样挂在林中，像金簪一样埋在白雪中。\n\n这首诗通过对比，表达了惜春对妙玉和自己命运的感慨，同时也暗示了她们各自的不同命运和结局。诗中“停机德”和“咏絮才”分别形容了妙玉和惜春的特点，而“玉带林中挂”和“金簪雪里埋”则寓指了她们未来可能的处境，暗示了一种命运的悲剧色彩。"

            "english": "She was already in a state of mind that made no allowance for a certain method, why should one speak of “necessity”? She was from the sky, so why should she not return to it? Shen Qingzhi had the maid light some incense. After she had sat still for a while, she turned over the book of chess and read some articles written by Kong Rong, Wang Jixian, and the like. She could not find any special wondrous about \"Lotus Leaf Wrapping Crayfish,\" or \"Yellow Robin Catching a Rabbit.\" \"Thirty-six Formations of Corner Murder\" was difficult to understand and remember. But she found \"Ten Dragons Racing Horses\" very interesting. Just as she was thinking about this, she heard a man enter the yard. \"Cai Ping!\" he called out.\n\n\"Sorry, who are you?\" Shen Qingzhi asked.\n\n\"I'm your brother-in-law, Du Jin. I wanted to see you.\" Du Jin replied.\n\nShen Qingzhi was stunned, \"Brother-in-law? How could you call me that?\"\n\n\"I'm your brother-in-law! How could I not call you that?\" Du Jin retorted. \n\n\"Well, my husband is dead, so how can you call me your sister-in-law?\" Shen Qingzhi asked.\n\nDu Jin was at a loss for words and then said, \"You're right. Since your husband is dead, you should no longer be called my wife. But as your brother-in-law, I want to help you.\"\n\nShen Qingzhi was surprised, \"Help me? How exactly can you help me?\"\n\nDu Jin hesitated for a moment, \"I have heard that you are a very smart woman. You are skilled in many things. I want to offer you a job to work for me, where you can use your skills.\"\n\nShen Qingzhi thought for a moment and asked, \"What kind of job?\"\n\nDu Jin continued, \"I own a business, and I need someone to manage it for me. You seem to be the right person for the job.\"\n\nShen Qingzhi was intrigued, \"What kind of business is it?\"\n\nDu Jin smiled, \"It's a business related to the silk industry. I believe your skills and intelligence would be very useful in managing such a business.\"\n\nShen Qingzhi considered the offer carefully. She knew Du Jin was a shrewd businessman, and she could see his keen interest in her. She was not foolish enough to reject such an opportunity without careful consideration.\n\n\"Alright, I'll take the job,\" Shen Qingzhi agreed. \"I will be your business partner. We will work together to make our business thrive.\"\n\nDu Jin was pleased with Shen Qingzhi's decision. He knew she was a capable woman, and he was confident that together they could make a great success of his business.\n\n\"Very good,\" Du Jin said, \"I look forward to working with you, Shen Qingzhi. You will find that this job suits you perfectly.\"\n\nShen Qingzhi smiled, \"I'm sure it will. Let's start working together right away.\"\n\nDu Jin nodded, and the two of them began to make arrangements for Shen Qingzhi to take up her new role. Shen Qingzhi's decision to take the job and work with Du Jin proved to be a wise one, and her skills and intelligence soon helped to make the business prosper.\n\nThe following morning, Shen Qingzhi woke up refreshed and ready to start her new job. She changed into her finest dress and left her courtyard, heading towards Du Jin's business office.\n\nAs she entered the office, Du Jin greeted her warmly, \"Good morning, Shen Qingzhi. I'm glad to see you here. Let's get started.\"\n\nShen Qingzhi smiled, \"Good morning, Du Jin. I'm glad to be here. I'm ready to start working on our business together.\"\n\nDu Jin looked pleased, \"That's great. We have a lot of work to do today, so let's get right to it.\"\n\nShen Qingzhi was impressed by the organized and efficient way in which Du Jin ran his business. She quickly adapted to the new environment and began to contribute her ideas and skills to the business.\n\nDu Jin was pleased with Shen Qingzhi's performance and found that her contributions were invaluable to the business. Together, they made great progress and the business began to flourish.\n\nOver time, Shen Qingzhi became an integral part of the business, and Du Jin trusted her completely. He knew that she was a woman of integrity and intelligence, and he appreciated her dedication and hard work.\n\nShen Qingzhi, on her part, was grateful for the opportunity to work with Du Jin and contribute her skills to the business. She felt fulfilled and content in her new role, and she looked forward to continuing to work with Du Jin to make the business even more successful.\n\nIn the end, Shen Qingzhi's decision to take the job with Du Jin proved to be a wise one. She found happiness and fulfillment in her new role, and the business flourished under her guidance and Du Jin's leadership. Together, they formed a strong partnership that lasted for many years, and Shen Qingzhi's contribution to the business was recognized and celebrated by all.",
