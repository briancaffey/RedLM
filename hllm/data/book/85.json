Feeling frustrated, A Sister decides to leave, but before she does, she encounters another character named \"Ploughshare\" who informs her that her brother, \"Er Er,\" has come with a message intended for her and A Sister. Er Er is waiting outside for a response. A Sister is angry at Er Er for not knowing that he usually attends school and feels that he should not be waiting outside for her to make a decision. Ploughshare reassures her that he has already informed Er Er and that Er Er has asked A Sister to decide the next course of action. This highlights the close relationship between A Sister and Er Er, as well as the respect A Sister has for Er Er's opinion and decisions. It also suggests that there is a tense relationship between A Sister and Lin Daiyu, as Lin Daiyu has not agreed to see A Sister.",
