This analysis provides valuable insights into the financial viability of a business. It enables decision-makers to assess the impact of various factors on profitability, such as changes in production costs, pricing strategies, and sales volume. By understanding the breakeven point, businesses can make informed decisions about pricing, production levels, and marketing strategies to optimize their financial performance.\n\nFind the derivative of {eq}g(x) = \\ln(4x^2 + 2){/eq}.\n\nWe will apply the chain rule to find the derivative of the given function.\n\nGiven {eq}g(x) = \\ln(4x^2 + 2){/eq}, we have:\n\n{eq}\\begin{align*}\n\ng'(x) &= \\frac{d}{dx}[\\ln(4x^2 + 2)]\\\\\n\n&= \\frac{1}{4x^2 + 2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}[4x^2 + 2]\\\\\n\n&= \\frac{1}{4x^2 + 2} \\cdot (8x)\\\\\n\n&= \\frac{8x}{4x^2 + 2}\n\n\\end{align*}\n\n{/eq}\n\nTherefore, the derivative of {eq}g(x) = \\ln(4x^2 + 2){/eq} is {eq}g'(x) = \\frac{8x}{4x^2 + 2}{/eq}.\n\nFind the cross product of the following vectors:\n$\\vec{a} = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n-\\frac{47}{10} \\\\\n-\\frac{9}{10} \\\\\n\\frac{23}{5} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right)$ and\n$\\vec{b} = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\frac{77}{10} \\\\\n\\frac{26}{5} \\\\\n\\frac{24}{5} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right)$\n\nThe cross product of two vectors $\\vec{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3)$ and $\\vec{b} = (b_1, b_2, b_3)$ is defined as:\n\n$\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\na_2b_3 - a_3b_2 \\\\\na_3b_1 - a_1b_3 \\\\\na_1b_2 - a_2b_1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right)$\n\nPlugging in the values of $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$, we get:\n\n$\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n-\\frac{9}{10} \\cdot \\frac{24}{5} - \\frac{23}{5} \\cdot \\frac{26}{5} \\\\\n\\frac{23}{5} \\cdot \\frac{77}{10} - \\left(-\\frac{47}{10}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{24}{5} \\\\\n\\left(-\\frac{47}{10}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{26}{5} - \\left(-\\frac{9}{10}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{77}{10} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right)$\n\nSimplifying each component, we get:\n\n$\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n-\\frac{1632}{25} \\\\\n\\frac{2671}{50} \\\\\n-\\frac{1043}{50} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right)$\n\nTherefore, the cross product of $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{b}$ is $\\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n-\\frac{1632}{25} \\\\\n\\frac{2671}{50} \\\\\n-\\frac{1043}{50} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right)$.\n####\nThe answer is $\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = \\left(\n\\begin{array}{c}\n-\\frac{1632}{25} \\\\\n\\frac{2671}{50} \\\\\n-\\frac{1043}{50} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right)$\n\nA particle's velocity is given by the function {eq}v(t) = 4t^3 + 3t^2 - 5t + 1 {/eq} for {eq}t \\geq 0 {/eq}. \n\na) Determine the total distance traveled by the particle from {eq}t = 0 {/eq} to {eq}t = 4 {/eq}.\nb) Calculate the total displacement of the particle during the same time interval.\n\nGiven the velocity function:\n\n{eq}v(t) = 4t^3 + 3t^2 - 5t + 1 {/eq}\n\na) To find the total distance traveled, we need to integrate the absolute value of the velocity function from {eq}t = 0 {/eq} to {eq}t = 4 {/eq}:\n\n{eq}\\text{Distance} = \\int_{0}^{4} |v(t)| \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{4} |4t^3 + 3t^2 - 5t + 1| \\, dt {/eq}\n\nSince the velocity function is positive for {eq}t \\in [0, 1] {/eq} and negative for {eq}t \\in [1, 4] {/eq}, we can split the integral:\n\n{eq}\\text{Distance} = \\int_{0}^{1} (4t^3 + 3t^2 - 5t + 1) \\, dt + \\int_{1}^{4} -(4t^3 + 3t^2 - 5t + 1) \\, dt {/eq}\n\n{eq}\\text{Distance} = \\left[ \\frac{4}{4}t^4 + \\frac{3}{3}t^3 - \\frac{5}{2}t^2 + t \\right]_{0}^{1} - \\left[ \\frac{4}{4}t^4 + \\frac{3}{3}t^3 - \\frac{5}{2}t^2 + t \\right]_{1}^{4} {/eq}\n\n{eq}\\text{Distance} = \\left( \\frac{4}{4} + \\frac{3}{3} - \\frac{5}{2} + 1 \\right) - \\left( \\frac{4}{4} \\cdot 4^4 + \\frac{3}{3} \\cdot 4^3 - \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot 4^2 + 4 \\right) {/eq}\n\n{eq}\\text{Distance} = \\left( 1 + 1 - \\frac{5}{2} + 1 \\right) - \\left( 256 + 48 - 40 + 4 \\right) {/eq}\n\n{eq}\\text{Distance} = \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\right) - 268 {/eq}\n\n{eq}\\text{Distance} = \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{536}{2} {/eq}\n\n{eq}\\text{Distance} = \\frac{-533}{2} {/eq}\n\nHowever, distance cannot be negative.

That ship was really strange. It set sail from Wuhu every year and would be blown up when it reached Hankou. When I boarded the ship, there was a forty-year-old businessman in the same cabin with me, and there were several other passengers, all from the local area. The next morning, when the ship arrived at Anqing, everyone woke up and saw that the river was covered in white. It turned out that there was a big snowstorm. The businessman was very happy and said, \"This year will have a good harvest, and I can make a fortune of several thousand taels of silver. We all should thank the heavens!\" He said this while the ship was already arriving in Nanjing.\n\n翻译以下中文文本成英文：\n\n她没有回答。她的眼睛凝视着窗外，思绪在飞舞。她想着，如果她能够回到过去，那么她会怎么做？她会如何改变那个让她遗憾不已的错误决定？她会如何挽救那个与她擦肩而过的幸福？然而，这一切都已经过去，她无法改变。她只能默默地承受着内心的痛苦，希望未来的日子能够给予她一些安慰。\n\nShe did not answer. She gazed out the window, lost in thought. She wondered what she would have done if she could go back to the past. How would she have changed the regrettable decision that had caused her so much sorrow? How would she have saved the happiness that had slipped away from her? But all of that was in the past, and she could not change it. She could only bear the pain in her heart silently, hoping that the future would bring her some comfort.\n\nTranslate the following Chinese text to English:\n\n三月三，荠菜当灵丹。荠菜是春季常见的野菜之一，具有清热解毒、利尿消肿、止血止痛等功效，对防治流行性感冒、咳嗽、肺结核、肝炎等疾病有一定的辅助作用。荠菜的做法也有很多，可以用来煮汤、炒菜、做饺子馅等。比如，将荠菜焯水后切成碎末，加入鸡蛋、盐、胡椒粉、油等调料，搅拌均匀，制成荠菜馅，包入饺子皮中，煮熟即可。此外，荠菜还可以用于制作荠菜蛋汤、荠菜炒蛋、荠菜豆腐等美食。\n\nMarch 3, wild apricot as a spirit.
