The Li family has a tradition of reading books, with both men and women reading extensively. However, when Li Shouzhong had a daughter, he believed that \"women without talent are virtuous,\" so he did not allow her to study seriously. Instead, he made her read \"The Four Books for Women\" and \"Biographies of Eminent Women,\" and she only knew a few characters and the stories of a few virtuous women from previous dynasties. She was taught to spin and weave as a primary skill, and so her name was Li Wannian, with the nickname \"The Queen of the Wardrobe.\" Therefore, even though Li Wannian was young and widowed, living in a wealthy household, she lived like a dried-up branch or a dead tree, showing no interest in anything. She only devoted herself to serving her father and educating her son, and in her free time, she accompanied her cousins in making embroidery and reading poetry.

In the past, Yinglian used to play with us every day and we got along very well. So, even after seven or eight years, even though she has become more beautiful, her appearance hasn't changed much, so I can recognize her. Moreover, Yinglian had a small piece of red henna on her forehead from birth. The old man also rented my house. That day, the old man was not at home, and I asked him about it. He was afraid of getting beaten, so he didn't say anything. Instead, he said that the old man was his own father, and he sold her because he couldn't pay off his debt. I kept trying to comfort him, and he started crying, saying, \"I don't remember anything from my childhood!\" This proves that he was telling the truth. On the day when Mr. Feng saw Yinglian, he paid for her and, because the old man was drunk, Yinglian spoke to herself, saying, \"Today, I've fulfilled my sins.\" Later, it was heard that she was getting married three days later, and she looked worried again. I couldn't bear to see it, so when the old man left, my wife went to talk to him: \"This Mr. Feng must come on a good day to take you, so you know that he doesn't see you as a servant. Besides, he's a very handsome and wealthy person who doesn't like women. He spent a lot of money to buy you, so you can imagine what kind of life you're going to have.\"The translation of the given Chinese text to English is as follows:\n\n\"Although Feng Gongzi was not very happy, but thinking that he only sold it to the Xue family, he comforted himself. However, he never expected that Xue Gongzi, the most famous \"dumb brigand\" and \"wild-tempered\" person, and someone who spent money like water, had taken Yinglian by force, and he didn't know if Yinglian was alive or dead, while he had spent money and lost his life, it was really令人可叹!\"",

Feng's family had a small population and only wanted some money for burial; however, Xue's family, relying on their influence and relationships, refused to compromise. Therefore, no judgment was made. Yucun then committed judicial misconduct and haphazardly decided the case, allowing Feng's family to receive a considerable amount of burial money, and they had nothing to complain about. Yucun then hastily wrote two letters to Jia Zheng and the Commander of the Capital Army, Wang Ziteng, saying, \"Your nephew's case is finished, and there is no need to worry.\" This matter was initiated by the novice sramana of the Hu葫芦庙, and Yucun was deeply displeased with him because he might reveal his past impoverished circumstances. Later, Yucun found a mistake in him and had him sent far away, which was the end of it.\n\nI have a script that I need to run 4 times, with different parameters each time. Is there a way to run this 4 times without having to do it 4 separate times?\n\nYes, there are several ways to achieve this in a programming language like Python.\n\n1. Using a loop: You can use a loop (for example, a for loop) to run the script multiple times with different parameters. Here is an example code snippet in Python:\n\nfor i in range(4):\n    # run the script with different parameters\n    # ...\n\n2. Using a parameter file: You can create a parameter file (e.g., a text file) that contains the different parameters for each run. Then, you can read the parameters from the file and pass them to the script. Here is an example code snippet in Python:\n\n# read the parameter file\nwith open(\"parameters.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n    parameters = f.read().splitlines()\n\n# run the script with different parameters\nfor parameter in parameters:\n    # run the script with the current parameter\n    # ...\n\n3. Using a command-line tool: Some command-line tools allow you to specify different parameters for each run on the command line. For example, if you have a script called \"myscript.py\" and you want to run it with different parameters, you can do something like this:\n\n# run the script with parameter 1\nmyscript.py arg1\n\n# run the script with parameter 2\nmyscript.py arg2\n\n# run the script with parameter 3\nmyscript.py arg3\n\n# run the script with parameter 4\nmyscript.py arg4\n\nNote that you may need to modify the code snippets above to fit your specific script and parameters.\n\nWrite a Java program that implements a stack using an array. The program should include methods for pushing an element onto the stack, popping an element off the stack, and checking if the stack is empty.

Ji Zheng's daily affairs are numerous, and he is a free-spirited person who does not consider the world as important. When he is free, he likes to read books and play chess. Moreover, the Liuyang Courtyard has two floors and a street gate, which allows for free access and exit. These young men can play freely. Therefore, Xue Pan also abandoned the idea of moving.",
