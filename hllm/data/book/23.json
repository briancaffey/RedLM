Unexpectedly, the mother of Jaean, Fong, who lives on the back street, is planning to come to Lord Jagged's side to ask for a small position for her son to manage and earn some money. She heard about this event by chance and came to the wife of the famous woman, Fong, by car. Fong, knowing that she is a clever and slippery person, agreed to her request. After thinking about it, she told the Lady Wang that these little monks and Taoists should not be sent to other places, as they might be needed by the queen later. She suggested sending them to the temple of Iron Gate Mountain, where they could be called upon when needed. This would save a lot of trouble and expense.",

The Chamber of Jin Yun is situated on a small island in the lake, which can be accessed by a narrow bridge.\n\nThe Chamber of Jin Yun has a long and rich history, dating back to the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279). The pavilion was originally built as a private residence by a wealthy family in the area, but it later became a popular tourist destination. In the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the Chamber of Jin Yun was reconstructed and expanded, becoming a symbol of the beauty and elegance of the West Lake.\n\nToday, the Chamber of Jin Yun is a popular attraction for tourists visiting Hangzhou, known for its stunning views of the lake and its rich history. It is also a popular spot for Chinese ink wash paintings and calligraphy, and the area is known for its beautiful gardens and scenery.\n\nCan you provide me with some information on the history of the Jin Yun Pavilion during the Qing Dynasty? I'm curious to learn more about its reconstruction and expansion. During the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the Jin Yun Pavilion underwent a significant reconstruction and expansion. In 1751, the pavilion was completely rebuilt by a wealthy businessman named Zhang Zhidong, who had a love for the arts and culture. Zhang employed some of the best architects and craftsmen of the time to redesign the pavilion, making it one of the most beautiful and elegant structures in the area.\n\nThe reconstruction of the Jin Yun Pavilion was a massive undertaking, requiring the construction of new buildings, bridges, and gardens. The new pavilion was designed to incorporate traditional Chinese architectural styles, with intricate wood carvings, delicate stone carvings, and beautiful gardens. The main pavilion was surrounded by smaller buildings and pavilions, creating a complex of structures that blended together seamlessly.\n\nThe reconstruction of the Jin Yun Pavilion was not only a testament to the wealth and culture of the Qing Dynasty, but it also symbolized the Chinese love for beauty and the arts. The pavilion quickly became a popular tourist destination, attracting visitors from all over the country and even from abroad.\n\nToday, the Jin Yun Pavilion is still a popular tourist attraction, and its reconstruction and expansion during the Qing Dynasty is considered one of the most significant events in the history of the area. It is a testament to the beauty and creativity of Chinese architecture and culture, and a symbol of the rich history of Hangzhou.",

            "english": "Daiyu walked to the corner of the wall of the peach blossom courtyard, and only heard the flute sound and song sound inside the wall. She knew it was the twelve girls practicing the play. Although she did not pay attention to listening, two or three notes accidentally drifted into her ears, and she could hear the exact words, \"It's the beginning of everything, and it's all paid to the broken well and ruined wall!\" Daiyu listened and felt very moved. She stopped, tilted her head, and listened carefully. She also heard, \"It's a beautiful day and a happy time, but who has a happy time at home?\" Daiyu nodded and sighed, thinking to herself, \"It's a good article in the play! It's a pity that people only know how to watch the play and can't appreciate the fun.\" Thinking about it, she regretted that she should not have been distracted by her thoughts and missed the singing. She listened again, and just heard, \"It's only for your beautiful face and your endless years.\" Daiyu was moved and moved. When she heard, \"You are lonely in the lonely room,\" she was even more like a drunken dream. She could not stand, so she sat down on a rock, and slowly savored the taste of \"like a flower, like a flowing spring.\"He then recalled a line from an ancient poem that said \"the flow of water and the falling of flowers have no pity.\" He also remembered a phrase from a song that read \"the flow of water and the falling of flowers, spring has gone, heaven and earth are separated.\" In addition to that, he thought about the sentence from \"The West Chamber\" that stated \"the falling of flowers and the flow of water, countless worries.\" All these thoughts came together, causing him to become sad and lost in thought. Suddenly, he felt a tap on his shoulder and turned around to see who it was.",
