Wilson, a renowned biologist and author, introduced the concept of \"hedgehog\" in his book \"The Social Conquest of Earth\" (2011). This concept refers to a specific and focused strategy that a species or individual employs to achieve its goals. In the context of the natural world, hedgehogs are small animals known for their spiky coats. They have a simple, straightforward approach to survival: they use their spines to protect themselves from predators and to catch prey. This simplicity and focus allow hedgehogs to thrive in their environment.\n\nIn the context of the \"hedgehog concept,\" E. O. Wilson suggests that humans and other complex organisms can learn from the simplicity and effectiveness of hedgehogs. He argues that in today's world, where complexity and specialization have become the norm, people and societies may be better off if they adopt a more focused and straightforward approach to problem-solving and decision-making. The hedgehog concept encourages individuals and organizations to identify their core strengths and values, and to focus their efforts on those areas rather than spreading themselves too thin.\n\nFactor the following quadratic: $-5 x^2+45 x+1360$\n\nTo factor the quadratic $-5 x^2+45 x+1360$, we can first factor out a $-5$ from each term:\n\n$-5 x^2+45 x+1360 = -5 (x^2-9 x-272)$\n\nNext, we can factor the quadratic inside the parentheses using the quadratic formula:\n\n$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$\n\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients of the quadratic equation.\n\nIn this case, $a = 1$, $b = -9$, and $c = -272$, so we have:\n\n$x = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{(-9)^2-4(1)(-272)}}{2(1)}$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$x = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{81+1088}}{2}$\n\n$x = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{1169}}{2}$\n\n$x = \\frac{9 \\pm 34}{2}$\n\nThere are two possible solutions for $x$:\n\n$x = \\frac{9 + 34}{2} = 22$\n\n$x = \\frac{9 - 34}{2} = -12.5$\n\nTherefore, the factors of $-5 x^2+45 x+1360$ are $-5 (x+12.5) (x-22)$.\n####\nThe answer is $-5 (x+12.5) (x-22)$\n\nHow can I prevent my wireless USB keyboard from disconnecting while connected to a Pi, which in turn shuts down the Pi? The keyboard should stay connected even when the Pi is not powered on.\n\nThis issue can occur due to the power-saving mode of the Pi. When the Pi is powered down, the USB devices, including the wireless USB keyboard, may disconnect. To solve this problem, you need to prevent the Pi from entering sleep mode.\n\nThere are two options to achieve this:\n\n1. **Disable Sleep Mode:**\n   Ensure that the Pi is set to not enter sleep mode. This can be done by navigating to the \"Advanced\" menu in the Raspberry Pi configuration settings and unchecking the \"Sleep Mode\" option.\n\n2. **Use a USB Hub:**\n   If you have a USB hub with a power switch, try plugging the keyboard into the hub's power supply. This ensures that the keyboard remains powered even when the Pi is not active.\n\nBy implementing one of these solutions, your wireless USB keyboard should remain connected to the Pi, even when the Pi is turned off.",

His parents passed away early, and he was naturally straightforward and unafraid of trifles. He was a keen swordsman, gambler, drinker, and had a passion for sleeping with women and playing music on the flute and piano. He engaged in all sorts of activities. Because he was young and handsome, he was mistaken by some as a performer. His close friend, Lai Shangrong, who was a relative of the family, invited him to a gathering. During the gathering, Lai Shangrong invited Lai Song and others to join the group. At the party, Lai Song was intoxicated, and his old habits resurfaced. Lai Song was upset and wanted to leave, but Lai Shangrong insisted that he wait for his nephew, Lai Lian, to return from a business trip.

I need to go and help with the preparations.\" Lai Lian agreed and the party continued without him.Baoyu said, \"That's why.

He said, 'Not only were they not damaged, but they were even fresher than before.' I thought maybe these friends had recently cleaned up the tomb. I'm just sorry I'm always locked up in the house and can't do anything by myself. As soon as I do something, someone always stops me or advises me.
