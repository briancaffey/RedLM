He turned the first page and saw some pictures, but they were so blurry that he couldn't make them out. There were a few lines of writing on the last page, but they were not very clear either. He squinted and read them carefully, and then saw a character that looked like \"Lin\" in the painting. He wondered if it could be the Lin little sister. So he read more carefully. There were four characters at the bottom: \"Jin Zan Xue Li\". Jia Baoyu was puzzled, how could this resemble Lin's name? He read the first four lines together and thought there was no real reason for it, just that it concealed Lin's name, but it wasn't strange. However, he couldn't understand the words \"怜\" and \"叹\". This was a mystery. He suddenly spat and thought about how he had been reading the book secretly. If he got lost in thought, and someone came, he wouldn't be able to finish reading. So he turned to the back of the book and started to read without looking at the pictures. When he reached the end, there were some lyrics, one of which was \"Hou Er Xiang Feng Da Meng Gu\". He suddenly understood and thought that it had to be Lady Yuan Chun. If everything was as obvious, he wanted to copy it down and slowly contemplate it, to know the fates of all the sisters. But he would never tell anyone, being able to know the future without knowing it. This would save him many unnecessary speculations. He looked around and didn't see any writing tools. He was afraid someone would come, so he just hurriedly read the twelve poems. Some he understood at a glance, some he understood when he thought about them, and some he didn't understand, but he still remembered them. As he sighed, he read the \"Jin Ling Zi Fu Zhi\", and saw \"Can xian you li you fu, who knew that the son was without fate\". At first, he didn't understand, but when he saw the shadow of a flower bed, he was shocked and cried. He wanted to read more, but then he heard someone talking, \"You're spacing out again, Lin little sister is calling you!\" The voice sounded like that of the Cocker Spaniel, but when he turned around, there was no one there. Jia Baoyu was puzzled, but then he saw the Cocker Spaniel waving outside the door. He hurried over, and saw the Cocker Spaniel walking ahead, looking blurry.
