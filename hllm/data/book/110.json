Here's an example implementation:\n\nfunction fibonacci(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) {\n    return n;\n  }\n\n  let fib = [0, 1];\n\n  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n    fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];\n  }\n\n  return fib[n];\n}\n\nIn this code, the `fibonacci` function takes an input `n` and returns the `n`th Fibonacci number. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `n` itself. Otherwise, it initializes an array `fib` with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1). Then, it iterates from index 2 up to `n`, calculating each Fibonacci number by adding the previous two numbers in the `fib` array. Finally, it returns the `n`th Fibonacci number.\n\nYou can call this function with any positive integer `n` to calculate the corresponding Fibonacci number. For example:\n\nconsole.log(fibonacci(10)); // Output: 55",

These days, he follows the old man kneeling, and we can see that he is not comfortable. He wants to run over to his wife as soon as the old man moves. He talks to her for a long time, even making his wife not talk to him. He then goes to find Qin Qing, and Qin Qing hides from him. Even the Xing sisters don't talk to him much anymore. But our cousins, Xixi and Si Si, always call him \"big brother\" and are very close to him. \"We see that the second son, except for mixing with grandmothers and daughters, probably doesn't have anything else in mind.

Today, even though there are some nice places here, they are not complete. Tomorrow, I will take you to see other places.

It's interesting how Jia Zheng is trying to pass on this tradition to Jia Huan, but Jia Huan doesn't seem to be very interested in it. He's more focused on playing with the foreign beauty in the mirror.\n\nEmily: That's true. But I think Jia Zheng is trying to find a way to connect with Jia Huan and make him appreciate the beauty of their gardens and the art of poetry and music. Maybe he's trying to find a way to inspire Jia Huan to create something beautiful of his own.\n\nJames: Yeah, that's possible. I wonder if Jia Zheng will be successful in his efforts to teach Jia Huan about poetry and music. Do you think Jia Huan will eventually come around and appreciate the beauty of their gardens?\n\nEmily: I hope so.
