Lady Wang had to follow Lady Xing's wishes, and the others were even less likely to step in. Only Lady Li Wán could see how hard Lady Wang Yingzhen was working, but she dared not speak out for her, only sighing and saying, \"They say that 'Even a beautiful peony needs leaves to support it'. If the ladies don't give face to Lady Wang Yingzhen, who else will help? If Young Miss Yingzhen were still alive, it would be easier, but now, with only her own family members rushing around, they are whispering behind her back, saying that not a single coin is being spent and that she's not even saving face. Father is only focused on his mourning, and doesn't understand the details of the estate. This is a big affair; how can it be handled without spending some money? How unfortunate that Lady Wang Yingzhen has been working so hard for so many years, and now, in her grandmother's passing, she might even not save face!\" She then called in some of Lady Wang Yingzhen's loyal attendants and instructed them, \"Don't look at how others are behaving and copy them in criticizing Young Master Lin's wife. It's not that mourning and performing rites are big affairs, they're just days to pass. When you see people struggling to organize, you can help them a little bit. This is a matter of duty, and everyone should contribute.\" The usual attendants who followed Lady Li Wán's instructions agreed, saying, \"Mrs. Li is right. We dare not do such a thing. We've only heard that Lady Yüng's maids are criticizing Young Master Lin's wife.\" Lady Li Wán responded, \"Even Lady Yüng, I have spoken with her about this. I said that Young Master Lin's wife isn't neglecting her grandmother's affairs; she's just not in charge of the finances. Even a clever cook can't make porridge with no rice, right? Now, Lady Yüng understands this, so she's not holding a grudge anymore. It's just that Lady Yüng's behavior seems a little strange. This is odd: when her grandmother was alive, she wasn't overbearing; but now, her grandmother is gone, and she seems to have lost her backbone. I was worried about her before, but luckily, since Father isn't home, she's been able to dodge the trouble; otherwise, what could she do?\"",
