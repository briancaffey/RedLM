            "english": "As for the translation, it is a literal translation with slight simplification, assuming that the context provided should allow for comprehension. \"Dumbfounded\" for \"尤氏发呆\" is an inaccurate translation. The intended meaning is \"to be dazed\" or \"to be at a loss for words\", as if to say \"she was too embarrassed to say anything\". \"Scolding\" for \"大骂\" is also an inaccurate translation. The correct term here would be \"reprimanding\" or \"scolding\" with an emphasis on the context that Eileen is upset about the situation. \"Underworld\" for \"阴间\" is an incorrect translation. It should be translated as \"the underworld\" or \"the afterlife\". \"To be in the afterlife\" would suggest a scenario where the person has passed away, which is not the intended meaning. The context in which this term is used here is in a more metaphorical sense, referring to the idea of being away from the living world. \"You actually asked me that?\" for \"你倒问我\" is an appropriate translation. This sentence is used by Yu Shi to imply that Eileen is being the one who should be asked for the situation that transpired last night, not the other way around, due to her own indiscretion.

Either way, it's not right. So I might as well not tell one. He then stood up and said, \"I don't know how to tell jokes. Could you please give me another topic?\" Senior Wang Zheng said, \"Well, since that's the case, I'll give you a topic to test you: write a poem based on the word 'autumn.'

Quickly fetch paper and brush.\" Senior Wang Zheng said, \"Writing poetry doesn't need to be filled with words like 'water,' 'crystal,' 'ice,' 'jade,' 'silver,' 'color,' 'light,' 'plain,' and so on.

The midwife replied, 'I'm not sticking the needle in her heart, just her ribs, and that will be fine. The son asked, 'The heart and ribs are so far apart, how can you possibly cure her?' The midwife replied, 'Don't worry, you don't know how much mothers love their children. A mother's heart is in her child's ribcage.'\" Everyone laughed at this. Jiá Mǔ only drank half a cup of wine, and said, \"If that midwife had stuck a needle in my ribcage, it would have made me feel better.\" Jiá Shè heard this and knew he had spoken carelessly and that his mother might be angry, so he quickly stood up and refilled her cup, trying to make up for it.
