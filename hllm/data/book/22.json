The vector field is F = (y, z, x) and the normal vector is pointing upward.\n\nLet us find the flux of the vector field F across the surface S:\n\nWe have to integrate the normal vector of the surface with the given vector field.\n\nThe surface S can be represented as a parameterization as:\n\nr(u, v) = (u, v, 6 - 3u - 2v)\n\nwhere 0 ≤ u ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ v ≤ 3 - 3u/2.\n\nThe normal vector of the surface S is given by:\n\nN = r_u × r_v\n\nwhere r_u and r_v are the partial derivatives of r(u, v) with respect to u and v, respectively.\n\nCalculating the partial derivatives:\n\nr_u = (1, 0, -3)\nr_v = (0, 1, -2)\n\nCalculating the cross product:\n\nN = r_u × r_v = (-3, 2, 1)\n\nThe dot product of the normal vector N with the vector field F is:\n\nN · F = (-3y, 2z, x)\n\nSubstituting the parameterization into the dot product:\n\nN · F = (-3v, 2(6 - 3u - 2v), u)\n\nNow, we can set up the surface integral:\n\nFlux = ∬_S F · N dS\n\nwhere dS is the differential area element on the surface S.\n\nFlux = ∬_R (-3v, 2(6 - 3u - 2v), u) · (-3, 2, 1) dA\n\nwhere R is the projection of the surface S onto the uv-plane.\n\nFlux = ∬_R (9v - 4(6 - 3u - 2v) + u) dA\n\nFlux = ∬_R (9v - 24 + 12u + 8v + u) dA\n\nFlux = ∬_R (17v + 13u - 24) dA\n\nFlux = ∫_0^2 ∫_0^(3 - 3u/2) (17v + 13u - 24) dv du\n\nFlux = ∫_0^2 [17v^2/2 + 13uv - 24v]_0^(3 - 3u/2) du\n\nFlux = ∫_0^2 (51 - 51u/2 + 13u^2/2 - 72 + 36u) du\n\nFlux = ∫_0^2 (-21 + 13u^2/2 - 15u) du\n\nFlux = [-21u + 13u^3/6 - 15u^2/2]_0^2\n\nFlux = -42 + 13(8)/6 - 15(4)/2\n\nFlux = -42 + 52/3 - 30\n\nFlux = -42 + 17/3\n\nFlux = -42 + 17/3\n\nFlux = -126/3 + 17/3\n\nFlux = -109/3\n\nTherefore, the flux of the vector field F across the surface S is -109/3.\n\nWhich is the better deal? The Burger Barn sells 4 burgers for $3.96. The Hamburger Hotel sells 6 burgers for $6.30.\n\nTo determine which deal is better, we need to calculate the cost per burger for each restaurant.\n\nFor the Burger Barn:\n4 burgers for $3.96\nCost per burger = $3.96 / 4 = $0.99\n\nFor the Hamburger Hotel:\n6 burgers for $6.30\nCost per burger = $6.30 / 6 = $1.05\n\nSince the Burger Barn has a lower cost per burger ($0.99 vs. $1.05), it is the better deal.\n\nFind the Jacobian matrix of the vector-valued function $\\mathbf{r}(x, y, z) = \\langle f(x, y, z), g(x, y, z), h(x, y, z) \\rangle$, where $f(x, y, z) = \\sqrt{x}$, $g(x, y, z) = \\cos^{-1}(y)$, and $h(x, y, z) = e^z$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix of $\\mathbf{r}(x, y, z)$ is given by:\n\n$$J(\\mathbf{r}(x, y, z)) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} \\\\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} \\\\\\ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} & \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} & \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial z} \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nCalculating each partial derivative, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial z} = 0$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-y^2}}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial z} = 0$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} = 0, \\quad \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial z} = e^z$$\n\nTherefore, the Jacobian matrix of $\\mathbf{r}(x, y, z)$ is:\n\n$$J(\\mathbf{r}(x, y, z)) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x}} & 0 & 0 \\\\\\ 0 & -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-y^2}} & 0 \\\\\\ 0 & 0 & e^z \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nWhen did the U.S. dollar cease to be backed by gold, and what was the primary reason for this change?\n\nThe U.S. dollar stopped being backed by gold on July 13, 1971, as a result of President Richard Nixon's executive order. This move marked the end of the Bretton Woods System, which had been in place since 1944, and it led to the dollar's transition to a fiat currency, relying on the credit of the U.S. government rather than a fixed gold standard.",

I forgot just now, why didn't I encourage you to make up riddles in front of your father? You must be sweating now!\" Bai Yu was annoyed and grabbed Feng Zhu to wrestle for a while.",
