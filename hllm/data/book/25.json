Everyone was in a panic.\n\n第十七回  大观园试才题对额  荣国府归省庆元宵\n\nChapter 17: The Grand View Garden Tests Its Talent in Inscribing Titles on the Gates\n\n大观园的题对额活动终于开始了，贾政为这个活动煞费苦心，要以此来考验林黛玉、贾宝玉、贾探春、史湘云、薛宝钗、贾迎春、贾惜春等众姐妹的才智。\n\nThe inscribing titles on the gates of the Grand View Garden was finally underway. Mr. Jia Zheng had made great efforts for this event, and he wanted to test the intelligence of Lin Daiyu, Jia Baoyu, Jia Qiongchen, Shi Xiangyun, Xue Baochai, Jia Yingchun, and Jia Xichun and the other sisters.\n\n贾政先问林黛玉、贾宝玉、贾探春三个才女的对联。林黛玉第一个想到了“有凤来仪”，贾宝玉则联想到“红香绿润”，而贾探春则想到了“杏帘在望”。贾政非常满意，于是又问其他姐妹。\n\nMr. Jia Zheng first asked the three talented sisters, Lin Daiyu, Jia Baoyu, and Jia Qiongchen, about their couplets. Lin Daiyu thought of \"Heralded by the Peacock,\" Jia Baoyu thought of \"Red Fragrance and Green Lubricity,\" and Jia Qiongchen thought of \"Elderly Reeds in Sight.\" Mr. Jia Zheng was very satisfied, and so he asked the other sisters.\n\n接着，贾政又问了史湘云、薛宝钗、贾迎春、贾惜春的对联，湘云想到了“芝兰之室”，宝钗想到“锦心绣口”，迎春想到“映日荷花别样红”，惜春则想到“曲径通幽”。贾政对这些对联感到非常满意，于是他决定给这四座门楼分别题写对联。\n\nNext, Mr. Jia Zheng asked Shi Xiangyun, Xue Baochai, Jia Yingchun, and Jia Xichun about their couplets. Shi Xiangyun thought of \"A Chamber Filled with Fragrant Ferns and Orchids,\" Xue Baochai thought of \"A Threaded Heart and a Woven Mouth,\" Jia Yingchun thought of \"Red Lotus in the Sun Is of a Different Color,\" and Jia Xichun thought of \"A Curving Path Leads to the Enclave.\" Mr. Jia Zheng was very satisfied with these couplets, and so he decided to inscribe the four gate-towers with their respective couplets.\n\n大观园的题对额活动圆满结束，展现了姐妹们的才华。然而，紧接着，宝玉和黛玉之间的一场情感冲突即将上演，为大观园的热闹生活增添了一份情感波澜。\n\nThe inscribing titles on the gates of the Grand View Garden was a great success, highlighting the talents of the sisters. However, a conflict between Baoyu and Daiyu was about to unfold, adding a wave of emotions to the lively life of the garden.",
