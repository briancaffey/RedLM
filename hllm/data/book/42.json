This garden looks like a painting, with mountains, trees, pavilions, and houses, neither too far nor too close, and just the right amount. If you were to copy the painting onto paper, it would not be good. You need to consider the size of the paper, whether it is far or near, and whether it is the main or secondary element. You need to add where needed, hide where needed, and reveal where needed. This rough draft needs to be carefully considered and decided before it can become a complete picture. The second thing is that these pavilions and houses must be bordered. If you are not careful, the railings will be crooked, the pillars will be collapsed, the doors and windows will be turned upside down, and the stairs will be out of shape, even tables will be pushed into the wall, and flower pots will be placed on the curtain. It would become a joke. The third thing is to arrange the people in the painting, which also needs to be spaced out and have a sense of height. I believe that drawing clothes, skirts, and hair is the most important thing. If one stroke is not fine enough, the face will be drawn fat, or the feet will be drawn lame, and coloring the face and tearing the hair are minor issues. If it were up to me, I would not be able to draw it.\"English translation:\n\nNowadays, a year's vacation is too long, and a month's vacation is too short.
