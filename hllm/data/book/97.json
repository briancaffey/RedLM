He already had a tendency for foolish and foolish behaviors, and after such a turmoil tonight, his mind was unstable. He would think of things for a while and then forget them, unable to even recognize his own family members. Whatever others said, he would only listen, constantly calling out for Lin Er. The elders such as Jia Mou, went up to comfort him, but he did not listen. Both Baochao and others were present, but it would be inappropriate for them to speak out. The others knew that Baoyu was having a relapse of his old illness, but they did not dare to say it directly. They only lit some incense in the room and let him calm down and go to bed. The room was very quiet. After a while, Baoyu fell asleep. The elders slightly relaxed, but could only sit and wait for dawn. They sent FengZhi to invite Baochao back to her room to rest. But Baochao was not bothered at all, she wore her clothes and slept in her room. Jia Zheng was outside and did not know the situation inside, only guessing from what he saw earlier, he felt somewhat relieved. Fortunately, tomorrow was a good day for travel, they took a slight rest, and the others came to congratulate them and see them off. Seeing that Baoyu was sleeping, Jia Mou also went back to rest.",

I have already followed your advice in the matter of Bao-yu, and I only hope that you will instruct him.\" Jia Zheng was concerned that his mother might be worried about him on the way, so he did not mention Bao-yu's relapse of his illness. He only said, \"I have something to say. Bao-yu got married yesterday, but they did not have conjugal relations. You are leaving today, and you should have him accompany you. But since he was sick, and now has recovered only partially, and he was exhausted yesterday, it might be bad for him to be out. So, I wanted to ask you: if you want him to come, then send for him. If you want to spare him, then have him brought to see you, and let him give you a bow.\" Jia Zheng answered, \"What does it matter if he comes or not? I am happier when I know that he is devoting himself to his studies.\" Hearing this, Jia Zheng's mother was reassured.
