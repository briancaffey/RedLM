He stood still, listening to the symphony of nature around him, and in that moment, he felt a sense of peace and tranquility he hadn't experienced in a long time.\n\nSuddenly, he heard a soft voice calling out his name. It was Shu Ling. She appeared behind a cluster of blooming flowers, her face pale but with a gentle smile. Shui Jing's heart skipped a beat, and he immediately rushed to her side.\n\n\"Shu Ling, you're looking a little better,\" he said, his voice filled with concern.\n\n\"I'm much better, thank you,\" she replied, her eyes glistening with gratitude.\n\nThey spent the evening under the moonlight, chatting and catching up on each other's life. Shui Jing couldn't help but feel drawn to her, marveling at her resilience and grace despite her illness. They talked about their shared memories, dreams, and even their future aspirations. As the night wore on, they realized how much they had missed each other and how much they still had to learn from one another.\n\nAs the moon began to set, Shui Jing realized that the time had come for him to leave. He promised to return the next evening, and they shared a tender goodbye. From that night on, their meetings became more frequent, and their bond grew stronger with each encounter.

While mathematical complexity can be a challenge in capital budgeting, it is not typically considered a criticism of the process itself. In fact, the use of mathematical models and techniques is often seen as a strength of capital budgeting, as it allows for more precise and objective decision-making. The other options (incomplete data, uncertainty, and subjectivity) are all valid criticisms of capital budgeting, as they can lead to errors and biases in the decision-making process.

She had never expected that she would end up in such a situation. Would she be able to find her way back to the past, or would she be trapped in this parallel universe forever? She felt a deep sense of regret for not appreciating her life and the people around her before it was too late. \n\nSuddenly, she felt a surge of energy coursing through her body. She stood there, feeling the unfamiliar sensation, and realized that something extraordinary was happening. \n\n\"Am I... dying?\" she thought to herself, unsure of what to make of the situation. \n\nA voice, not her own, echoed in her mind. \"No, dear, you're not dying. You're merely transitioning to a new phase of your existence.\" \n\nLin Zhaohao was taken aback by this sudden intrusion into her thoughts. She had never experienced anything like it before. \n\n\"Who are you?\" she asked, trying to maintain her composure.\n\n\"I am your guide, a being that transcends time and space. I've been waiting for you to wake up and accept the truth about your situation.\" \n\nLin Zhaohao was overwhelmed by this revelation. She felt a mix of confusion, fear, and curiosity all at once. \n\n\"What truth? What situation am I in?\" she inquired, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\n\"You're in a parallel universe, a universe where your life has taken a different path. You've been given a second chance to experience life in a new way. This is your opportunity to learn, grow, and make different choices than you did in your previous life,\" the voice explained.\n\nLin Zhaohao felt a wave of emotions wash over her. She realized that her life was indeed different from what she remembered. She felt a sudden surge of determination to understand this new reality and embrace the possibilities it presented.\n\n\"I want to know more. How do I navigate this universe? How do I find my way back to my original life?\" she asked, her voice filled with a mixture of hope and trepidation.\n\n\"The journey begins with self-discovery and acceptance. You must learn to trust the process and believe in the path that has been set for you. There are no shortcuts, but with courage, wisdom, and patience, you will find the way forward. Remember, this is a lesson in resilience and growth. Embrace every moment, and you will find the answers you seek,\" the voice replied, leaving Lin Zhaohao with a sense of hope and determination to explore this new reality.\n\nAs she continued her journey, Lin Zhaohao began to understand the unique challenges and opportunities that lay ahead. She learned to appreciate the present, to make the most of each moment, and to see the beauty in the differences that set this universe apart from her own. Through her experiences, she found a deeper sense of self and a newfound appreciation for life, no matter the form it took.\n\nIn the end, Lin Zhaohao discovered that life, in all its forms, is a continuous journey of growth, learning, and self-discovery. It doesn't matter whether one is in a parallel universe or the original reality, the true essence of life lies in embracing the experiences and lessons that come with it.

He told her that since their last parting, he had been yearning for her and longed to see her again. He expressed his gratitude, stating that he had never forgotten any moment they spent together, and those cherished memories had given him warmth in this lonely world.\n\nShe listened quietly as he shared his stories, a warm wave surging within her. They shared their tales, discussed the past and the possibilities of the future. On this simple and ordinary night, they rediscovered the pure and profound friendship that had been forgotten.

Seeing his father, he fell into a slightly calmer frame of mind, and spoke and acted more or less as he should. He listened to his father's instructions, and then went back as instructed, while his father returned to his room. He told Wangfeng to keep a close eye on his son, and make sure he didn't go off the rails again. Yuanyang was ordered to take part in the provincial exams next year. Wangfeng agreed to everything, but didn't mention any other matters. She got up and had Yunyang and the others escorted out of the room. The rest of the women then left as well. The rest of the men, including Jizhen, got the brunt of his father's lecture. The group drank a cup of wine to see him off, and then the group of young men and relatives walked with him for another ten li before they parted ways.",
