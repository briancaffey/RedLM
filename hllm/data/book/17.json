The governor had already inspected it, and now it was waiting for Jia Zheng's inspection. If there were any deficiencies, they could be improved before inscribing the title or couplets. Jia Zheng listened and thought for a while, saying, \"This is a difficult matter. According to the rules, it should be granted by the imperial concubine, but she has not seen the scenery herself, so it would be hard to guess. If we wait until the imperial concubine comes for a visit to have her name inscribed, then the major attractions, no matter how many pavilions and pavilions, without word titles, even if they are flowers and greenery, cannot be colorful. The gentlemen who were listening laughed and said, \"Old man, you're right. Now we have an idea: we can write the inscriptions for each place, whether it's two words, three words, or four words, and try to match their meaning. Then we can temporarily hang them as lanterns for the title and couplets. When the imperial concubine visits, we can ask for her name, and that will be a win-win situation.\" Jia Zheng agreed, saying, \"You're right.\" We should go and look today, and if the inscriptions are good, we can use them. If they are not, we can invite Mr. Yu to rewrite them.Everyone laughed and said, \"Sir, you have determined it to be good today, why wait for Rongguan?\" Jia Zhen laughed and said, \"You don't know. I have always been mediocre at flower and bird poetry and painting. Now that I'm older and too busy with paperwork, I've forgotten how to write these kinds of poems and paintings. If I write something now, it might be too old-fashioned and make the beautiful gardens and pavilions lose their charm. It would be no fun.\" The well-known poets said, \"That's not a problem. We can all read what you've written, and if it's good, we keep it. If it's bad, we delete it. That's a good idea.\" Jia Zhen said, \"That's a great idea.

And there were no trees or flowers, only many strange plants. Some plants had vines, while others had tendrils. Some plants hung from the mountain ridges, others clung to the rocks, and some even draped over the eaves and columns, winding around the steps. Some appeared as delicate green ribbons, while others looked like gold ropes twisting around. Some were the color of red sand, while others had flowers resembling golden osmanthus. The fragrance was rich and pungent, far surpassing that of ordinary flowers. Ji Zheng could not help but say, \"This is fascinating! But I don't recognize these plants.\" Some people guessed they might be stinging nettle and ivy. Ji Zheng replied, \"Stinging nettle and ivy wouldn't have such a strange fragrance.\" Then, the young man said, \"Actually, these plants do include stinging nettle and ivy. The one with a strong fragrance is called Tricholoma. That one is probably Coriaria. This one might be Cissus. That one could be Poa. And this one might be Plectranthus. And this one is likely Perilla. And this one is probably Perilla. The red one is probably Thymus. And the green one is likely Plectranthus. I imagine that the exotic plants mentioned in the poems like 'Shao Tang' and 'Wen Xuan' might include things like Torenia, Pteridium, and Phlomis, mentioned in the 'Wu Du Fu'. And there are also things like Salvia, Datura, and Hyacinthus, mentioned in the 'Shu Du Fu'.\"\n\nThanks.\n\nYou're welcome! If you have any other questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help.\n\nCould you tell me more about the relationship between plants and poetry?\n\nCertainly! Throughout history, plants have been a common source of inspiration for poets, writers, and artists. Many poets have written about the beauty, fragrances, and symbolic meanings of various plants. For example, the poem \"Ode to a Nightingale\" by John Keats describes the beauty of a nightingale singing among the flowers, while the poem \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" by T.S. Eliot describes the fragrances of flowers that Prufrock imagines while he contemplates the fragility of life.\n\nIn many cultures, plants are also used symbolically to represent various emotions, ideas, or states of being. For example, in Chinese culture, plum blossoms are often used to represent perseverance and strength in the face of adversity, while chrysanthemums are associated with elegance and refinement. In Western culture, roses are often used to symbolize love and passion, while daffodils are associated with hope and renewal.\n\nThe relationship between plants and poetry is complex and multifaceted, and there are many different ways in which plants have been used as inspiration for writers throughout history. Whether it's the beauty of a flower or the fragrances that fill the air, plants continue to inspire poets and writers to this day.\n\nCould you tell me a story about a poet and a flower?\n\nSure! Here's a story about a poet and a flower:\n\nThere was once a poet named Robert, who loved nothing more than to spend his days exploring the natural world and writing about the beauty of nature. One day, while taking a walk through a local park, Robert stumbled upon a rare and beautiful flower that he had never seen before. The flower was a delicate pink color, with tiny petals that seemed to glow in the sunlight.\n\nRobert was captivated by the flower's beauty, and he spent hours observing it and trying to capture its essence in his writing. He wrote poems and songs about the flower, describing its delicate scent and the way its petals seemed to dance in the breeze.\n\nAs Robert continued to spend time with the flower, he began to feel a deep connection to it. He saw it as a symbol of beauty and hope, and he felt inspired by its resilience and ability to thrive in even the most challenging of environments.\n\nOne day, as Robert was walking through the park with the flower, he noticed that it had begun to wilt. Despite his efforts to save it, the flower eventually withered and died. Robert was heartbroken, and he felt as though he had lost a dear friend.\n\nBut even as the flower faded away, Robert continued to write about its beauty and the lessons that he had learned from it. He realized that even in death, the flower had left a lasting impression on him, and he knew that he would always carry its spirit with him.\n\nFrom that day forward, Robert continued to explore the natural world and to find inspiration in the beauty of nature. And though he never forgot the flower that had captured his heart, he knew that there were many more wonders waiting to be discovered, just around the corner.\n\nCan you give me a list of all the Chinese characters in the text?\n\nSure!
