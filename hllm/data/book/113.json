I'll never do it again!\" At other times, with her hands joined in prayer, she would cry out in agony, her eyes bulging, blood streaming from her mouth, and her hair in disarray around her.

Regaining her composure, Lady Feng recalled that You'ri was already deceased, suggesting she had returned to settle her accounts.

Let's go and have some tea.\" She dragged Liu Laolao to the guest room and told Qing Er to take care of Qiao Ji. Liu Laolao said, \"I don't need tea. Pretty girl, go and help your auntie give Madam a salute and comfort the old lady.\" Ping Er replied, \"Don't rush. We won't be able to leave the city today. I was worried that you might say something that would upset Madam, so I urged you out. Don't think too much about it.\" Liu Laolao said, \"Ah弥陀佛, pretty girl, you're overthinking it. How is Madam's illness?\" Ping Er asked, \"Do you think it's serious?\" Liu Laolao said, \"It doesn't look good.\" Just then, they heard Feng Jiang calling. Ping Er went to Feng Jiang's bedside. Feng Jiang didn't say anything. Ping Er was about to ask Feng Jiang's maid, Feng Nv, when Jia Lan came in, looked at Feng Jiang lying on the bed, and didn't say anything either. He went to a separate room and sat there angrily. Only Qiutong followed him into the room. She poured tea, served him for a while with great care, and didn't know what they were whispering about. Later, Jia Lan asked Ping Er, \"Doesn't Madam want to take her medicine?\" Ping Er replied, \"What would happen if she doesn't take her medicine?\" Jia Lan said, \"I don't know. Bring me the key to the cabinet.\" After Ping Er gave him the medicine, Jia Lan didn't say anything and left the room with the medicine. Qiutong stayed in the room and waited for Jia Lan to finish. She noticed that Jia Lan was both angry and anxious, with a pale face, and she was frightened. Then, she left. When she got to Feng Jiang, Jia Lan didn't say anything, but Feng Jiang asked about the medicine. Jia Lan said, \"I had something on my mind just now and forgot to tell you. You and Liu Laolao have heard about Grandmother's illness. It's very serious, and she may not last long. Tomorrow morning, I want to invite two monks and Taoist priests to recite sutras for her. Ping Er, go and tell your mother to prepare some incense, food for a religious ceremony, and incense for us to light tomorrow. In the evening, Feng Nv and you can help. Don't let Baoshan know about this. She's clumsy and weak, and she'll be heartbroken if she finds out.\" Ping Er agreed. Then, Qiutong came in, ready to leave for home. Jia Lan said, \"Okay, you can go home.\" Then, he asked Ping Er if Feng Nv had returned home. Ping Er said that Feng Nv had left home in the afternoon. Jia Lan then asked if Feng Nv's parents had returned home yet. Ping Er said that they hadn't come back yet. Jia Lan instructed Qiutong to pack her things, and she would take them back with him tomorrow morning. Qiutong packed up and left. Jia Lan told her to wait for him to finish packing and then follow him. Ping Er and Qiutong left together. Jia Lan placed the medicine next to Feng Jiang's bed and then left the room. When Ping Er and Qiutong returned, Jia Lan was no longer in the room. Jia Lan was sitting under an old mulberry tree a short distance away, where he was hiding in the shade. He scratched his ears and nose, and his eyebrows were tightly furrowed, as if he was deep in thought. The news of his mother's serious illness, along with his despair and anger, was swirling in his heart. He regretted not having made a decision earlier, and now he could only wait for fate's arrangement. Ping Er and Qiutong saw him at the entrance and quickly ran over to call him inside, but Jia Lan refused. Ping Er told Jia Lan that she had invited Liu Laolao and two old maids, who were already ready and waiting in the guest room. Jia Lan nodded, asked Ping Er and Qiutong for help, and then stayed under the tree, deep in thought. #DreamOfRedMansion#",
