I won't let them bother me, and see what they can do!\" He listened for a while, but there was no sound. Xue Ke didn't dare to eat the wine and fruit, and closed the door of his room. Just as he was about to take off his clothes, he heard a faint noise outside the window. Xue Ke was nervous because he had been teased by Baochan, and his mind was in turmoil. He couldn't figure out what to do. When he heard the noise on the window paper, he looked carefully, but there was no movement. He started to doubt himself, covered his chest, sat in front of the lamp and stared blankly. He picked up a piece of fruit and looked at it over and over again. Suddenly, he turned his head and saw a wet spot on the paper on the window. He walked over and saw that there was a gust of wind outside, which startled him. Outside, a voice said, \"Why doesn't Mr. Xue drink and eat fruit and go to bed?\"",
