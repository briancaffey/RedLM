The Shunzhi Emperor (r. 1644-1661) is the fifth emperor of the Ming dynasty, and his reign is often referred to as the \"Shunzhi Emperor's reign\" in Chinese history texts. It seems that in the context of the novel, this period is being used as a historical backdrop. The author does not directly associate the characters or events with the Shunzhi Emperor himself, suggesting that the novel's setting and narrative are not directly tied to a specific historical event involving him. The use of historical figures and events as a backdrop is common in Chinese literature to add a layer of richness and depth to the narrative, often to explore themes that are relevant to the time period or to provide a sense of authenticity and realism. The Shunzhi Emperor's reign is particularly interesting for its role in the transition from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty, as well as its cultural and political developments, which could potentially provide a backdrop for the complex dynamics of family, power, and identity that are explored in the novel. However, the main focus of the novel appears to be on the intimate lives and relationships of the characters, rather than historical events or figures.",

She sent for two maids and an old servant, and asked them to look for the jade in every part of the garden. She also ordered someone to go around telling everyone that whoever found it would be generously rewarded. Everyone at first was too anxious to escape suspicion that they were willing to risk their lives in the search. They looked everywhere, even the privy, but without any results. The jade was as small as a needle and there was no trace of it. It was not until night that探春 sent people to look for it under the moonlight. She ordered all the servants to look under the moonlight, not caring whether they were awake or asleep. They searched every corner of the garden and even looked under the stones and in the bushes. They even searched the pond and the wells. After searching for hours, they finally found the jade in a small groove under a bush.探春 was overjoyed and immediately rewarded the servants. She then ordered them to clean the area and restore everything to its original state. She also instructed the servants to be more careful in the future. The servants were relieved and happy to receive the reward.

Think about it: from the maidservants that belong to the Old Lady, to you, Ping'er, who’s hand is not unsteady? Who has a narrow mind? If I return to the Old Lady and actually find out who did it, it will be good; otherwise, it is very likely to cut off Baoyu's life.\" Lady of the house replied, \"We have so many servants and so many hands and it’s always been said, ‘we can’t know a person’s heart, even if we can see his face’. How can we ensure that someone is good? But, if we make a ruckus, everyone will know about it. If the one who stole the jade is caught and knows he’ll die, he’ll become frantic, even to the point of destroying the jade to cover his tracks. What can we do then? According to my foolish idea, since Baoyu has never liked the jade in the first place, losing it is not so serious. All we need to do is to be more careful, and not let the Old Lady and Lord know about it. Thus, we can secretly send people to all the places, trick him into confessing, then we’ll get the jade back, and be able to pin the blame on him. I wonder how Lady Wang feels about this?\"",
