We've been through a lot together, and at the very least, we should visit her grave and burn some paper to pay our respects. Even though she didn't leave us any children, we shouldn't let the path of the ancestors become lost for the sake of the descendants.\" After a moment, Jia Lian replied, \"You really thought about everything.\" The Phoenix Empress' words left Jia Lian speechless, and he lowered his head in thought, saying, \"Since it's not needed until tomorrow, you can use as much as you like from the supplies we have on hand.\"\n\nTranslate the following sentence to French:\nThe fire and rescue team from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was on hand to extinguish a small fire that broke out in the kitchen, but the damage was minimal.\nÉquipe de sauvetage et de lutte contre les incendies de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada était présente pour éteindre un petit feu qui s'est déclaré dans la cuisine, mais le préjudice était minimal.\n\nTranslate the following sentence to French:\n5.01.15 Further, the Board of Directors shall, in all cases, approve the application of the policies set forth in paragraph 5.01.14. 5.01.15 De plus, le conseil d'administration doit approuver, dans tous les cas, l'application des politiques énoncées à l'article 5.01.14.\n\nTranslate \"The following is a list of current and historical parties in the French Senate:\" to French? Voici une liste des partis actuels et historiques dans le Sénat français :\n\nCette phrase en français indique qu'un tableau ou une liste est fourni qui contient les noms des différents partis politiques présents dans le Sénat français à la fois actuellement et dans le passé. Le Sénat français est le corps législatif à vie de la France, composé de membres nommés par le président de la République. Les partis politiques jouent un rôle important dans le fonctionnement du Sénat en fournissant des candidats pour remplir les sièges disponibles.\n\nTranslate \"Why don't you tell us what kind of a product you're looking for?\" to French? Pourquoi ne pas nous dire quel type de produit vous recherchez ?\n\nThe translation of \"Why don't you tell us what kind of a product you're looking for?\" to French is \"Pourquoi ne pas nous dire quel type de produit vous recherchez ?\". In this sentence, \"pourquoi\" means \"why\", \"ne pas\" is a negation, \"nous dire\" means \"tell us\", \"quel\" is a pronoun that means \"what\", \"type\" is a noun that means \"kind\" or \"type\", \"de produit\" is a prepositional phrase that means \"of a product\", and \"vous recherchez\" is a verb that means \"you're looking for\".\n\nTranslate the following sentence to French:\nThe application of the law of the sea is not restricted by territorial waters. La mise en application du droit de la mer n'est pas restreinte par les eaux territoriales.\n\nIn this translation, \"The application of the law of the sea\" corresponds to \"La mise en application du droit de la mer\" in French, \"is not restricted\" is translated to \"n'est pas restreinte\", and \"by territorial waters\" is translated to \"par les eaux territoriales\". The sentence maintains the same meaning in French as it does in English.\n\nTranslate \"The application of the law of the sea is not restricted by territorial waters.\" to French? La mise en application du droit de la mer n'est pas limitée par les eaux territoriales.\n\nIn this translation, \"The application of the law of the sea\" is translated to \"La mise en application du droit de la mer\", \"is not restricted\" is translated to \"n'est pas limitée\", and \"by territorial waters\" is translated to \"par les eaux territoriales\". This translation accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence in French.\n\nTranslate the following sentence to French:\nThat is why the rules should cover the relevant fields, including the following: That is why the rules should cover the relevant fields, including the following:\n\nCette phrase peut être traduite en français comme suit :\nC'est pourquoi les règles devraient couvrir les domaines pertinents, y compris les suivants :\n\nDans cette traduction, \"That is why\" est traduit par \"C'est pourquoi\", \"the rules\" est traduit par \"les règles\", \"should cover\" est traduit par \"devraient couvrir\", \"the relevant fields\" est traduit par \"les domaines pertinents\", \"including the following\" est traduit par \"y compris les suivants\".\n\nTranslate the following sentence to French:\nIt is generally thought that the severe symptoms of the disease are caused by the inactivation of key genes in the nervous system. On croit généralement que les symptômes sévères de la maladie sont causés par l'inactivation de gènes clés dans le système nerveux.\n\nDans cette phrase, on utilise le subjonctif présent du verbe \"croire\" (on croit) pour exprimer une opinion ou une croyance. \"Severe symptoms\" est traduit par \"symptômes sévères\", \"disease\" par \"maladie\", \"caused by\" par \"causés par\", \"inactivation\" par \"inactivation\", \"key genes\" par \"gènes clés\", et \"nervous system\" par \"système nerveux\".\n\nTranslate \"A1306.040 - 2003-06-01.\" to French? \"A1306.040 - 2003-06-01\" is a reference number, a date, and an abbreviation. Since it's not a complete sentence, it's not possible to provide a complete translation into French. However, here's a breakdown of the components:\n\n- \"A1306.040\" is an abbreviation, which likely represents a specific code or identification number in a particular context. As it is not a word or a phrase, it cannot be translated.\n- \"2003-06-01\" is a date in the ISO 8601 format, which is the most common international standard for representing dates. In French, this date would be written as \"2003-06-01\" or, in a more formal way, \"le 1er juin 2003\".\n\nSo, if you are referring to the date part only, the translation would be \"le 1er juin 2003\".\n\nTranslate \"The number of registered students in the last three years is given below.\" to French? \"Le nombre d'étudiants inscrits dans les trois dernières années est indiqué ci-dessous.\"\n\nIn this translation:\n- \"The number of registered students\" is translated to \"Le nombre d'étudiants inscrits.\"\n- \"in the last three years\" is translated to \"dans les trois dernières années.\"\n- \"is given below\" is translated to \"est indiqué ci-dessous.\"\n\nThis sentence is now presented in French, maintaining the original meaning and context.",

There is plenty of silver here, just take it first. If we are short later, we can borrow it the same way.\" The eunuch said: \"Grandfather Xia said he still owes 1200 taels of silver from two years ago, and he will pay it back at the end of the year.\" The Empress Dowager Cixi laughed and said: \"Your grandfather is too stingy. What's the point of remembering that? I'll tell you what, it's not worth remembering: if he remembers to pay us back, we would owe him an even bigger debt. I don't know if we have any silver, but if we do, take it.\" Then she called for Wang Er's wife, \"Go, borrow 200 taels of silver from somewhere.\" Wang Er's wife understood, and smiled, saying, \"I just came to ask you to borrow some money, but you're already giving me 200 taels.
