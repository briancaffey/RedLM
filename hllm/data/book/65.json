The second sister couldn't think of her name. Jialin guessed it must be the same person and laughed and said, \"I've known who this person is for a long time, and I have a good eye for it.\" The second sister and the elder lady were also sure it was Baoyu. The third sister spat and said, \"We have ten sisters, and you want to marry ten brothers? Don't you think there are good men in the world other than your family?\" Everyone was surprised and said, \"Other than him, who else could it be?\" The third sister said, \"Don't just think about the present, think about five years ago.\"\n\nTranslate the following Chinese text to English:\n\n林黛玉道：“我去了，这钟点也差不多了。”说毕，便起身告辞。宝玉知道他心里伤感，又不便留他，因说道：“你瞧那公案上摆的那块玉，又是你送我的。好生放着罢。”林黛玉听说，不觉红了脸，低头不语。宝玉又道：“你不去，我可自去罢了。”黛玉听说，方转身回来，仍复如前。宝钗便拉了他去，二人到房。宝钗笑道：“你瞧瞧，他那嘴！我说的不错罢。”黛玉道：“你好歹和他别闹！我知道你心里有气。”宝钗笑道：“你别说他，你还不知道我呢？他能伤到我？我反能伤到他。”黛玉笑道：“罢，罢，我不和你闹了，作罢，作罢。”说毕，自己也笑着去了。\n\nLin Daiyu said, \"I'm going, it's almost time.\" She then got up and said goodbye. She knew he was feeling sad, so he didn't want to keep her. He said, \"Look at that desk and the jade you gave me. Take care of it.\" Lin Daiyu said, \"I'm sorry, I'm not very good at taking care of things.\" She lowered her head and didn't say anything. He said, \"If you don't go, I'll go myself.\" Lin Daiyu turned around and came back, still being her usual self. Xue Baochai pulled her to her room and said, \"You see how he talks! I told you he would do that.\" Lin Daiyu said, \"Please don't talk about him, I know you're angry.\" Xue Baochai said, \"You don't understand me. He can't hurt me, but I can hurt him.\" Lin Daiyu laughed and said, \"No, no, no, let's not talk about him. Let's just leave it alone.\" She then laughed and went away.\n\nTranslate the following Chinese text to English:\n\n二姐道：“你是自己说的，又来推。你自然有你的好处，那里只是外人只说‘凤姐’罢了。”\n\nThe second sister said, \"You said it yourself, now you're trying to back out. You obviously have your own good qualities, but people only talk about 'the great lady'.\"\n\nThe second sister is acknowledging that she knows the person being referred to, and is questioning why they are trying to deny or disavow their own good qualities. They are implying that the person is trying to hide their true self or avoid responsibility for their actions. The phrase \"you said it yourself\" suggests that the person has previously acknowledged their own strengths or qualities, but is now trying to dismiss them. The second sister is challenging this behavior, and questioning why they are trying to disown their own good qualities.\n\nIn English, the second sister's response could be translated as, \"You said it yourself, now you're trying to back out. You obviously have your own good qualities, but people only talk about 'the great lady'.\"",
