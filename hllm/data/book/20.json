Ying'er feels very sad, but after hearing the girl say this, she dare not speak, so she puts down the money and mutters to herself, \"A person who is a boss still owes us money! A few coins aren't even enough to see. The other day, when I played with the little girls, I lost so much money, but he didn't even feel upset. The rest of the money was taken by the little girls, and he just laughed it off.\" When Baochai heard this, she quickly stopped him. Jia Huan cried, \"I can't compare to Bao Yubai. You all fear him and like him, but you all make me feel like I'm not the son of my mother!\" He then started crying. Baochai quickly comforted him, \"My dear brother, you mustn't say such things. People will laugh at you.\"\n\nIn the given text, it can be inferred that Jia Huan feels inferior compared to Bao Yubai, as he mentions that everyone likes Bao Yubai, but no one cares about him. This leads to his feelings of sadness and being bullied because he feels that he is not treated fairly.\n\nTranslate the following.\n\nEnglish: In 2011, the 2011 Internet World Stats ranked the country as the 28th largest worldwide market in terms of number of Internet users.\n\nSpanish:\n\nEn 2011, las estadísticas de Internet del mundo en 2011 clasificaron al país como el 28° mercado más grande del mundo en términos de número de usuarios de Internet.\n\nExplanation: The given English sentence is about the 2011 ranking of a country as the 28th largest market worldwide in terms of the number of Internet users. In Spanish, the sentence starts with the year (2011) followed by the action (clasificaron) which means \"ranked\". The country is referred to as \"al país\" which means \"the country\". The ranking is specified as \"28° mercado más grande del mundo\" which means \"the 28th largest market in the world\". Finally, the context is explained as \"en términos de número de usuarios de Internet\" which means \"in terms of number of Internet users\".",
