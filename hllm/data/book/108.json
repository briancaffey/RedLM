As Jia Zheng had no place to live, the properties and the Great View Garden were sealed. Since the Great View Garden was next to You's and Xue Chen's residences, it seemed too vast and empty, so Jia Zheng ordered Bao Yong to watch over the abandoned garden. Currently, Jia Zheng is in charge of the household and has followed Jia Mi's orders to reduce the number of people, and to save money, but they are struggling to support themselves. Fortunately, although Wang Fu is not Jia Mi's favorite, she can be trusted to manage the household and still in charge. Recently, since the family's wealth was seized, their finances are tight. The family members who used to live a comfortable life are now used to living a frugal life, and so, their complaints are unceasing. Wang Fu cannot refuse this task and in front of Jia Mi, she pretends to be healthy to please her.\n\nNote: I have attempted to capture the tone, meaning, and context of the original Chinese text while translating it into English.",

Then he saw his servant, or perhaps her name was袭人, coming towards him and asked what had happened. The young man replied, \"I don't know, I just feel very restless. Maybe we should go and visit Jia Jin's wife while everyone is busy drinking.\" The servant said, \"Why go and see Jia Jin's wife? What are you looking for?\" The young man said, \"I don't know, I just want to see her and see how her house looks.\" The servant had no choice but to follow him. As they walked, they talked. When they reached Jia Jin's house, there was a small door that was half open and half closed. The young man didn't go in. He saw two old women sitting on the doorstep talking. He asked, \"Is this door open?\" The old women said, \"It's usually closed. But today someone said they were going to pick fruit from the garden for the old lady, so they opened the door to wait.\"",
