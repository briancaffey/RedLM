The emperor again issued an edict to inform the world that no family with a noble title could entertain or have music within a year, and that ordinary people were not allowed to get married or take new wives for three months. The Jia grandmother and her descendants had to go to the court every day to participate in the sacrificial ceremonies until sunset. After twenty-one days in the secondary palace, the coffin of the old Empress Dowager was moved to the ancestral tomb, which was located in the Xiaozhi county. The tomb was about a dozen days' journey from the capital. As the coffin had arrived here, it would take a few more days to enter the underground palace, so there was a one-month gap. Jia Zhen and his wife also had to go to be in mourning. Since there was no one to oversee the two families, they all discussed reporting the matter of You's giving birth, and having her set aside to handle the affairs of the Jingnan two families.\n\nOnly the foreign merchant is a bit confused, \"Didn't you say they had started their mourning ceremony? Why would you still be here and not enter the temple?\" It seemed that the merchant was still not clear about what was going on. \"The mourning ceremony is in fact quite difficult to perform, especially when it comes to the spirit of the deceased. It is not as simple as the living going to the temple to remember the dead. There are many different customs and traditions, and each sect has its own unique rituals. The most difficult part is to understand the various customs and traditions, and to adapt to them. Once you understand the meaning of the ceremony, it is not that difficult. The hardest part is that we need to be present during the mourning ceremony. We cannot go to the temple now, as we would be seen as disrespectful. We must wait until the end of the mourning period to enter the temple and pay our respects.\"\n\nThe foreign merchant nods in understanding, \"So, this is not just a simple ritual, but a complex ceremony that requires understanding and respect for the deceased and their customs. It is a way for us to show our respect and remember the dead, and to bring closure to their passing. It is a sign of respect and a way to honor them.\" He nods in understanding, \"Yes, it is a way for us to show our respect and remember the dead, and to bring closure to their passing. It is a sign of respect and a way to honor them.\" The foreign merchant is now able to appreciate the complexity and significance of the mourning ceremony, and he understands the importance of respecting the customs and traditions of the deceased.

The Rongning household decided to leave the management of household affairs to Dali and a few stewards. However, this decision led to several issues. Some of Dali's subordinates had left, while others remained, and the newly appointed individuals did not satisfy Dali. These were individuals who lacked understanding and skill, often engaged in wrongful practices such as theft, false accusations, and荐people who were not suitable for their positions, causing chaos within the household. It was also observed that actors and actresses from noble households were exempted from taxes and subsequently dismissed. When discussing this matter, the family members considered the twelve actors and actresses in their household to be candidates for dismissal as well. However, Lady Wang believed that these individuals, originally sold into the profession, should be retained even if they did not perform. She proposed giving each of them a few ounces of silver to allow them to leave voluntarily, considering that they were originally daughters from good families and had been idle for several years. Lady Yu agreed that it would be more appropriate to ask each individual's preference and provide them with silver to return to their families, ensuring that their actual family members were responsible for their departure. Lady Wang concurred that this was a reasonable approach, adding that it would be best to rely on the family members to ensure the silver was used appropriately, and to keep those who chose not to return. Lady Yu deemed this solution satisfactory. In summary, the family members debated the appropriate course of action for managing household affairs and the disposition of actors and actresses, ultimately deciding to leave the decisions to the individuals involved, providing them with financial support to either leave or remain, with the aim of maintaining harmony and ethical considerations within the household. #宫# #宫# \n\nIn summary, the two households, Rongning and Jinling, had their respective masters preoccupied with their own business, leaving the management of household affairs to their stewards. In Rongning, Dali was tasked with overseeing the household, but challenges arose due to the departure of his subordinates and difficulties with new appointees. The household faced issues such as wrongful practices, false accusations, and inappropriate recommendations. In the context of official households, the entertainment staff was exempted from taxes and later dismissed. A discussion ensued about the twelve entertainers in their household, with Lady Wang advocating for financial compensation for their departure, considering their origins and circumstances. Lady Yu agreed on seeking the entertainers' preferences and providing them with financial assistance to return home, ensuring that their true families handled the departure. Lady Wang supported this approach, emphasizing the reliability of family members and the distinction between those choosing to leave and those who wished to stay. Lady Yu deemed this solution appropriate. #宫# \n\nThe essence of the passage lies in the reflection on the management of household affairs, the disposition of entertainers, and the importance of ethical considerations and family involvement in decision-making processes. The narrative showcases the complex dynamics within noble households, highlighting the challenges of leadership, the consequences of underestimating the impact of individual actions, and the significance of valuing and respecting the origins and desires of those involved. The resolution proposed by Lady Wang and Lady Yu emphasizes the role of personal agency, responsibility, and the ethical treatment of individuals, underscoring the importance of empathy, consideration, and fairness in managing diverse and sensitive situations within the household. #宫#",

Behind the rocks, there was a big apricot tree, its blossoms all fallen, its leaves green and lush, with apricots the size of beans already beginning to grow on the tree. Bao-yu thought: \"I've been ill for a few days, and I've neglected all the apricot blossoms. I didn't expect that the leaves would already be growing and the apricots would be beginning to bear fruit.\" He looked up at the apricots, feeling sad, and then thought about Xiong-xiaoyan, who had been married off.

It won't be two years before she will have \"grown leaves and borne fruit.\" Soon after, the apricot tree will have all its fruits on the tree, and in a few more years, Xiong-xiaoyan's black hair will be gray and her red face will be as white as a piece of silk. At this, he was saddened and kept sighing at the apricot tree. Suddenly, he saw a bird fly over and land on the branch, screeching. Bao-yu was startled and thought: \"This bird must have been here when the apricot blossoms were in full bloom. Now that it sees that the blossoms are gone, it is screeching in confusion. Its voice must sound like crying. I wish Gong-yang Chang were here, so I could ask him about it. But I wonder if the bird will come here next year to meet with the blossoms again.\" He was thinking about this when he heard a flare of sparks burst out from the rocks nearby, and the bird flew away.
