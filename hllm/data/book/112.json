But when it came to惜春, who saw such a scene, she was so frightened that she couldn't help but cry uncontrollably, not knowing who to call out for. She just kept wailing, from noon until night. The same was true for凤姐, who was also crying because she was unable to manage everything herself. When the old lady 贾母 heard about it, she was preoccupied with her own matters and couldn't come over, so she didn't do anything.

The rest have been given away.\" 王夫人 heard this and was also very troubled, but she managed to console惜春.惜春 didn't dare say much, only crying in silence.
