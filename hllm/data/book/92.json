Every year, Granny has a custom of holding a 'Snow Reminding Party' on this day. On that day, she invites a bunch of people and has a drinking party with them. I've already asked for leave from school today, but I don't know if Granny will write to me. If I go tomorrow, I'll have taken the leave for nothing; if I stay back, I'm afraid Father will find out that I'm slacking off.\" Xisi said, \"From my point of view, you'd better go. You've been studying so hard, and now you want to take a break. You should continue studying harder. Yesterday, I heard Mother say that Laoyao is studying very hard. He has been reading and writing articles after returning from school, and has stayed up late into the night. You're older than he is, and you're his uncle. If you fall behind him, Granny might be unhappy. So, why don't you go tomorrow?\" Xueyue said, \"In this cold weather, you have already asked for leave, but you still want to go. Doesn't that mean you're asking for leave but still going? If the teachers hear about that, they will say that you're asking for leave but still going and that you're ungrateful. In my opinion, you might as well take a day off. Even if Granny forgets, we don't need to hold a 'Snow Reminding Party', do we? We can still have one, you know.\" Xisi said, \"You'll just keep him home if you start telling him things like that.\" Xueyue said, \"I'm only trying to make the best of the day, and I'm not trying to outshine you.

The revised version tries to clarify this by placing more emphasis on the uncertainty of the attendant's role.
