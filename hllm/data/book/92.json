I have something to talk to you about.\" Jia Zheng said goodbye and left. Jia Zheng sent him to the door and said, \"I'll be right back.\" Jia Zheng then returned to his own room and told someone, \"Bring me Feng Zijing's letter.\" He saw Feng Zijing's letter on the table. Jia Zheng opened the letter and read it. It said, \"Feng Zijing is going back to Beijing because of family matters. He has asked Jia Zheng to help him with some things.\" Jia Zheng finished reading the letter, then wrote a letter and had someone take it to Feng Zijing. Feng Zijing read the letter and said, \"Thank you.\" Jia Zheng said, \"It's nothing, you don't need to thank me.\" Feng Zijing then left.",
