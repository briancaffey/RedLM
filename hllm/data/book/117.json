Upon hearing that the person was a monk, a panicked宝玉 rushed from the backyard to the main hall, shouting, \"Where is my master?\" After calling out for a while without seeing anyone, he had to go out again.

Upon seeing the monk's appearance, which matched that of the one he had seen before his death, he had a good idea of what was happening. Thus, he approached the monk and bowed, exclaiming, \"Master, your disciple was delayed in greeting you!\" The monk replied, \"I do not want your greetings, but only for you to bring me silver, after which I will depart.\"",

In this realm, Baoyu observes a play with two lines of lyrics that say, \"Don't know if the two ladies, Hsiung and Wang, agree or not, next time to be explained.\" The phrase \"explained\" here refers to revealing or clarifying the answer. In modern Chinese, this could be simplified as \"Don't know if Mrs. Hsiung and Mrs. Wang agree or not, next time to see the answer,\" conveying the essence and context of the original sentence.",
            "chinese": "不知道邢夫人和王夫人是否答应，下回分解。\n\n这句话是《红楼梦》中第五回中“太虚幻境”章节中的一句话，描绘的是贾宝玉在梦游太虚幻境时所见的一幕。太虚幻境中，宝玉观看了一出戏，戏中有两句唱词是“不知邢、王二夫人依与不依，下回分解”。这句话是说，宝玉不知道邢夫人和王夫人（这里特指贾母的两个儿媳）是否会接受或答应某件事情，他期待在下回的故事中揭晓答案。这里用“分解”来表示揭晓或解释的意思。整句话在现代汉语中可以简化为“不知道邢夫人和王夫人是否答应，下回再看答案”，传达了原句的基本意思和情境。"
