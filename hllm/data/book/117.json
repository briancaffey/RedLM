If people say that I am not able to tolerate my niece, and force her to become a nun, that's it. If she goes out, that's not possible; if she stays, then all the Madams are here. Let me decide. Have Jia Qiang write a letter to Uncle Yan, the second cousin, and we can get out of this.\" Jia Qiang agreed, and they all went their separate ways.",
            "chinese": "贾芸听了，便知是那回看家的时候起的念头，想来是劝不过来的了，便合贾蔷商议道：“太太叫我们进去，我们是做不得主的，况且也不好做主。只好劝去，若劝不住，只好由他们罢。我们商量了写封书给琏二叔便卸了我们的干系了。”两人商量定了主意，进去见了邢、王两位太太，便假意的劝了一回。无奈惜春立意必要出家，就不放他出去，只求一两间净屋子，给他诵经拜佛。尤氏见他两个不肯作主，又怕惜春寻死，自己便硬做主张，说是：“这个不是索性我耽了罢。说我做嫂子的容不下小姑子，逼的他出了家了就完了！若说到外头去呢，断断使不得；若在家里呢，太太们都在这里，算我的主意罢。叫蔷哥儿写封书子给你珍大爷琏二叔就是了。”贾蔷等答应了。"
