When Prince Yu was eager to see Qinzong, he decided to set the school start date for the next day and sent a letter. On this day, when Prince Yu woke up, Xisi had already arranged the stationery and other school supplies and was sitting beside the bed in a state of deep thought. Upon seeing Prince Yu wake up, she had no choice but to help him with his personal grooming. When he noticed her mood, he asked her, \"Dear sister, why are you unhappy again? Is it because I am not going to school and you are now free, that you are unhappy?\" Xisi laughed and said, \"What nonsense is this? Reading books is a good thing, but not reading books means you will just waste your time, and what will you do in the future? But you need to make a distinction between the right time to study and the right time to take care of the family. You cannot just play with them, you must behave yourself when you meet your father. Although you want to learn more knowledge, you cannot just greedily consume information. It is better to learn less but more deeply, and you should also take care of your health. This is what I mean. You need to think things through.\"",

He colluded with She Pan, using his authority and wealth to exert his influence. Not only did he fail to curb She Pan's behavior, he actually provided assistance for She Pan's misconducts. She Pan's nature was inherently fickle and changeable, favoring one thing today and another tomorrow. Once he made new friends, he would neglect his old ones. Even Jia Rui's close friend Jin Rong was discarded once She Pan and Xiang Yu entered the picture. Recently, even Xiang Yu was cast aside, leaving Jia Rui without any supporters. He did not blame She Pan for discarding old friends, but rather blamed Xiang Yu and Yu for not speaking up for him in front of She Pan. This resentment led Jia Rui and others like Jin Rong to feel envious of Xiang Yu and Yu. Now, the presence of Qin Xiang and his group brought about a sense of unease for Jia Rui, though he dared not directly confront Qin Zhong. Instead, he blamed Xiao Lian for meddling in his affairs, causing Xiao Lian to feel embarrassed and leaving Qin Zhong feeling awkward as he returned to his seat.",

Later, Yu Bo said, \"If we can't return home, that's fine. It's enough if Jin Rong apologizes to Qi Zhong.\" Jin Rong initially refused but, unable to withstand the pressure from Jia Rui, finally agreed to apologize to Qi Zhong. Eager for the matter to be resolved, Jia Rui whispered to Jin Rong, \"As the saying goes, 'To bear a moment's wrath brings a lifetime of peace.'\" Jin Rong had no choice but to meet with Qi Zhong. However, Yu Bo insisted that Jin Rong kneel and apologize. Jia Rui, wanting to put an end to the dispute, advised Jin Rong, \"An old saying advises, 'To bear a moment's wrath brings a lifetime of peace.'\" Jin Rong was forced to apologize to Qi Zhong. Despite this, Yu Bo still insisted on Jin Rong kneeling and calling out, \"I am sorry.\" Jia Rui, hoping to calm things down, informed Jia Rong about the entire incident, seeking his assistance. Jin Rong approached Jia Rong, explaining that he had unintentionally offended Qi Zhong and requesting leniency. When Jia Rong asked what he wanted in return, Jin Rong offered to cover all damages and take responsibility for his actions, asking that Jia Rong not reveal the matter to others. Seeing Jin Rong's sincere plea, Jia Rong agreed, and Jin Rong thanked Jia Rui, bringing the matter to a peaceful conclusion.",
