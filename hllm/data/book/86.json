Last year, we invited a so-called connoisseur of poetry, Ci, and drama, Mr. Cai Hao Gu, who we called \"Cai Hao Gu Ancient\", our family patriarch specially invited him to perform a piece of ancient Chinese music on the guqin, a type of zither.He picked up the guitar and began to play, but said that he couldn't use it in that way. He added that \"Mr. Old, if you are happy, bring the guitar tomorrow to teach me.\" We might have thought that his friend didn't understand poetry, so he didn't come to the party.Dear lady, how do you manage to conceal things?  Lady Daemon asks.A few days ago, when my body felt a little better, I browsed the bookshelves and found a set of sheet music.I find it quite interesting.  The book explains the clarity of the piano skills very well,  and the explanations of the techniques are easy to understand as well.It truly is an ancient method for people to calm their minds and nurture their inner peace.I was in Yangzhou when I heard about it.  Did you know that some people are very particular about China's traditional barbering culture?  They even learn multiple hair-cutting techniques.However,  now you don't need to continue \"this\" any further.(Note: In historical context, the yangzhou barbering industry faced significant打击 during the Qing Dynasty, as many customers switched to Western barbers due to political and social reasons. As a result, traditional Chinese barbering culture experienced a decline.The sentence says that if someone has not played the piano for three days, his fingers will grow hard thorns like vine hairs. This is a metaphorical way of expressing that not practicing or doing something you love regularly will result in your skills deteriorating.It conveys the importance of practice, no matter how small the skill may be; consistent and diligent practice is necessary to maintain proficiency and mastery.A few days ago, I looked at some works with just names and no lyrics, so I went to look for another work with lyrics to read.Such a reading experience is more interesting.Playing a piece of music really isn't easy;  it requires a great deal of practice and skill.The book says that  Shih Kuang can play the琴,  and his琴声 is able to summon winds and thunder as well as dragons and phoenixes.Confucius learned to play the piano from Master Zhongyi.  He figured out that it was the piano duet of King Wen in one attempt.Mountains and rivers flow continuously,  and it takes encountering a true soul companion for me...  And so I say,  my eyelids gently twitch,  and I lower my head slowly."

They sit quietly without letting their thoughts extend outward, and keep their body's vital energies and blood in harmony.In order to make one's spirit connect with the divine and achieve perfect harmony with the Dao,  one must first cultivate their abilities.Therefore, the ancients said: \"It is difficult to meet a bosom friend.\"\"If there's no audience, I would rather face the清风明月, the strange boulders, the wild apes, and the old cranes by myself, playing the piano to express my interests, before it's considered that I don't waste this piano.\"\"\n\nThis sentence describes the state of mind of a person who wants to express his emotions through music, even if he can't enjoy and appreciate them with nature's wonders such as the light breeze, the bright full moon, the magnificent old pines, the strange rocks, the wild apes, and the old stags. He feels that it would be a waste of such beautiful music if he doesn't do so.In addition,  the layout design and sound effects of this book are also very important.If one must play the piano, one must be dressed properly. One can wear a robe, a cloak, or dark clothing. It is important to maintain a respectable appearance as if one were an ancient Chinese scholar, in order to reach the境界 of a saint.Then wash your hands, dry them, light the incense burner and burn incense, and only then take your seat by the side of the bed, placing the琴\" on the table in front of you. Sit at the fifth step of the keyboard, facing backward, slowly lift your hands, and only then keep your body and mind properly aligned.To fully appreciate the plot's weight and pace within the book,  the storyline should be naturally fluid.  The unfolding and conclusion of the plot should be seamless.  Moreover, the body language and vivid imagery through descriptive details of the characters should be well-executed and dynamic.\"Yu Zhi said: \"We are just learning for fun. If we take it too seriously, it will be difficult.\"\"The title of the book isn't bad at all, why not take a closer look?\""
