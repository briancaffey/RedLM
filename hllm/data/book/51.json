This phrase reflects the mindset of a gambler who has already lost everything else, or is willing to risk everything, often implying a state of desperation or a desire to make a significant change through gambling. The gambler might be wagering their last remaining resources, hoping for a turn of luck that could potentially lead to a reversal of their fortunes. \n\nHere is an example of how it might be used in a sentence: \"Despite his debts and losses, he decided to gamble with 'neni gugao,' hoping for a stroke of luck to turn his misfortune around.\" \n\nKeep in mind that phrases like \"nothing to lose\" can have different connotations depending on the situation and the cultural context, so it's important to understand the nuances and implications in the specific scenario in which they are being used.",

            "english": "As they were discussing this with the Dowager Lady and Lady Wang, they decided that in winter it was not practical for the girls to run all the way to the house to eat, and it would be better to eat where they were. Lady Wang said, \"That is a good idea. In winter, when the wind blows and snow falls, the girls' bodies will be chilled if they eat and then run off to do something else. It is better for the girls to eat at the house in the back of the garden, which was built by the servants there. We have plenty of provisions for the garden, which can be paid for out of the accounts. We can send the wild game, the ducks, and other provisions to them.\" The Dowager Lady said, \"That is what I had been thinking. I was afraid it would involve too many people and too much work.\" The Lady Wang continued, \"There will not be very many. They will be a separate kitchen, but it will be the same food. Here will be a kitchen and fewer people to serve the meals there. And that will free up the kitchen people here. That way, the girls will not catch cold, and there is less for everyone else to do. But what about the girls like Lin Wei'er? She is not used to cold weather, and she has a bad constitution. And how can we expect the young master to be able to stand it?\"\n\nThe others agreed, and they proceeded to work out the details of the plan.",
