Upon arrival, he found the courtyard quiet with only maids and old ladies standing outside the windows, waiting. Pingle entered the hall and was greeted by Taochen, Taochen's sister, Taochen's wife, and their children. They were discussing some household matters, including an incident that occurred at Lai's home during the year when they were invited to a banquet. Pingle was asked to sit on the footstool in the hall. Taochen said, \"I have an idea. It's not about anything else, but I'm thinking about the monthly allowance of oil, powder, and other beauty products we receive. It's a matter of two jin. We already have two jin of monthly silver for each of us, and the maids also receive their own monthly allowance. Isn't that the same as the eight jin of silver we receive from the girls' school? Although this is a small matter, the money is limited, and it doesn't seem right. Why didn't my grandmother think of this?\" Pingle chuckled and replied, \"There is a reason for this. The things you girls use, such as oil, powder, and other beauty products, naturally have a share. Each of us is given this monthly allowance by the buying agent, who then passes it on to us for safekeeping. This is simply to prepare for your use, not for us to carry money and buy these things ourselves every day.\"Then the agent went out to buy things, and delivered them to us every month according to the room. As for the two ounces of silver that each girl received every month, it was not intended for these things. It was only to avoid bothering the housekeeper or the mistress when the girls occasionally needed money. Now, I'm looking at it, and I've noticed that half of the girls in each house are buying these things with their own money. I'm guessing that it's either because the agent is not delivering them or because they are not buying the real thing.\"探春和李纨都笑着说：“你也用心看出来了？没有脱空，只是晚些日子。催促急了，不知道从哪里弄一些来，不过是个名儿，其实用不了，还得再买一次。用两两银子，让别人的奶妈子的兄弟儿子去买，这才行。要用官中的，依然是那些东西，不知道他们是怎么做到的？”平儿便笑道：“买办买的那种东西，别人买了好的来，买办的也不依他，说他心存恶意，要夺他的买办。”\n\nDetermine the convergence or divergence of the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n^2}{1 + \\sqrt{n}}$ using the integral test.\n\nThe function $f(x) = \\frac{x^2}{1 + \\sqrt{x}}$ is positive, continuous, and decreasing on the interval $[1, \\infty)$. Therefore, we can apply the integral test.\n\n$$\\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^2}{1 + \\sqrt{x}} dx = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\int_{1}^{t} \\frac{x^2}{1 + \\sqrt{x}} dx$$\n\n$$= \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ 2x^{5/2} - 4x^{3/2} + 12x^{1/2} \\right]_{1}^{t}$$\n\n$$= \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ 2t^{5/2} - 4t^{3/2} + 12t^{1/2} - 2 - 4 + 12 \\right]$$\n\n$$= \\infty$$\n\nSince the integral diverges, the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n^2}{1 + \\sqrt{n}}$ also diverges by the integral test.\n\nIn the provided plot of sales data, which observation can be made?\n\nA. There is an outlier at the beginning of the dataset.\nB. The sales increase at a constant rate.\nC. The sales decrease at a constant rate.\nD. The sales exhibit a linear trend.\n\nThe correct observation is D. The sales exhibit a linear trend. This is because the data points form a straight line when plotted, indicating a constant rate of change in sales.\n\nWhat is the expected value of the function $f(x) = -4.6x^3 - 1.8x^2 + 3.8x - 1.5$ when $x$ follows a normal distribution with mean $\\mu = -1.3$ and standard deviation $\\sigma = 2.9$?\n\nTo find the expectation, we need to calculate $E[f(x)]$ where $x \\sim N(-1.3, 2.9^2)$. The expectation of a function of a normally distributed random variable can be found using the integral:\n\n$$E[f(x)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}} dx$$\n\nHowever, for the given function, it's more practical to directly substitute the mean into the function since the coefficients are constants:\n\n$$E[f(x)] = f(\\mu) = -4.6(-1.3)^3 - 1.8(-1.3)^2 + 3.8(-1.3) - 1.5$$\n\nCalculating this, we get:\n\n$$E[f(x)] \\approx 17.77$$\n\nSo, the expected value of the function is approximately $17.77$.The translation of the given Chinese text to English is as follows:\n\nTherefore, they would rather offend those inside, than those outside who handle affairs. If the girls employed wet nurses, they would not dare to speak ill of them.\n\nThe original Chinese text is a statement about a situation where someone (presumably a person of authority) is faced with a dilemma. They are choosing between offending those who are inside the organization (who have more power or influence) and those who are outside, handling affairs (who may have less power or influence but have a direct impact on their decisions).\n\nThe English translation captures the essence of the statement, highlighting the person's dilemma and the potential consequences of their actions. It also provides a clear and concise translation of the original text, preserving the meaning and intent of the original text.\n\nOverall, the translation is accurate and faithful to the original text, conveying the message effectively to an English-speaking audience.",

Now that we have created this new system, we are already above them, and they are still angry because they can't do anything about it.

You calculate it, how much does that save?\" said Pin'er with a smile. \"These few things may be small, but if you add them up for a year, it amounts to over four hundred silver dollars.\"\n\nWhich of the following is NOT one of the four most influential universities in India? ____\nA. IIT\nB. IISc\nC. JNU\nD. CUSAT\n\nThe correct answer is D. CUSAT.\n\nCUSAT, or Cochin University of Science and Technology, is a reputable institution in India, but it is not one of the four most influential universities in the country. The four most influential universities in India are IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology), IISc (Indian Institute of Science), and JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University).\n\nIITs are a series of autonomous public institutes of higher education, research, and training in technology and applied sciences in India. They are considered the most prestigious institutions for engineering and technology education in the country.\n\nIISc is a public research university located in Bangalore, Karnataka. It is known for its research in science and engineering and is considered one of the top universities in India.\n\nJNU is a public central university located in New Delhi. It is known for its liberal arts and social sciences programs and is considered one of the top universities in India.\n\nCUSAT, on the other hand, is a public university located in Kochi, Kerala. It offers courses in engineering, technology, science, and management, but it is not as well-known or influential as the other three universities on the list.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is D. CUSAT.\n\nDoes \"sea\" mean the same thing in these two sentences?\n\nThe sea is very rough.\n\nA sea battle.\n\nThe word \"sea\" in the two sentences has different meanings, but they are related. Let's break down the meanings of \"sea\" in each sentence:\n\n1. In the first sentence, \"The sea is very rough,\" the word \"sea\" refers to a body of saltwater that covers about 71% of the Earth's surface. This usage of \"sea\" refers to the vast body of water in which the oceanic waves are rough, or high and choppy.\n\n2. In the second sentence, \"A sea battle,\" the word \"sea\" again refers to the body of saltwater, but this time it is used to describe a specific type of naval warfare that takes place on the open sea. In this context, \"sea\" refers to the area where ships and naval vessels engage in combat.\n\nIn summary, \"sea\" in both sentences refers to the body of saltwater, but the context in which it is used in each sentence is different. In the first sentence, it refers to the body of water with rough waves, while in the second sentence, it refers to the area where a naval battle takes place.\n\nWhat are the most important words in the following sentence:\n\nA man in a white robe and a woman in a brown robe are praying\n\nIn the given sentence, \"A man in a white robe and a woman in a brown robe are praying,\" the most important words are \"man,\" \"woman,\" \"praying,\" \"white robe,\" and \"brown robe.\" These words are essential for understanding the core message of the sentence, which is that a man and a woman, each wearing a specific type of robe, are engaged in a religious activity called praying. These words provide the main subjects, their appearance, and the action they are performing, all of which are crucial for interpreting the sentence's meaning.\n\n1. \"Man\" and \"woman\" are significant because they indicate the participants in the scene, specifying that it is a male and a female involved in the activity.\n2. \"Praying\" is a crucial word because it tells us the main action or activity happening in the sentence.\n3. \"White robe\" and \"brown robe\" are important because they provide a visual description of the clothing worn by the participants, indicating their possible religious affiliations or roles.\n\nIn summary, the most important words in the sentence are \"man,\" \"woman,\" \"praying,\" \"white robe,\" and \"brown robe,\" as they provide the essential elements of the scene and the context of the activity.\n\nWhat are the most important words in the following sentence:\n\nthe president and the prime minister share a joke\n\nIn the given sentence, \"the president and the prime minister share a joke,\" the most important words are \"president,\" \"prime minister,\" and \"joke.\" These words carry the main meaning of the sentence and are essential for understanding the core idea. Let's break down their significance:\n\n1. \"President\": This word refers to the head of state or government of a country. It sets the context and establishes the subject of the sentence. Knowing that the president is involved in the sentence gives us an idea that the sentence is about a formal or high-ranking individual.\n\n2. \"Prime minister\": This word refers to the highest-ranking official in the government of a country, who usually holds the position of head of government. Like \"president,\" it sets the context and establishes another subject, which is the prime minister. This word also implies that the sentence is about a formal or high-ranking individual.\n\n3. \"Joke\": This word is the central action in the sentence, as it describes the interaction between the president and the prime minister. A \"joke\" suggests that the two individuals are sharing humor, lightheartedness, or a form of social interaction. It sets the tone of the sentence and provides a context for the relationship between the president and the prime minister.\n\nIn summary, the most important words in the sentence \"the president and the prime minister share a joke\" are \"president,\" \"prime minister,\" and \"joke,\" as they provide the core elements of the sentence, establishing the context, subjects, and the action taking place.\n\nWhat are the most important words in the following sentence:\n\nThe match was cancelled because the weather was too bad.\n\nIn the given sentence, \"The match was cancelled because the weather was too bad,\" the most important words are \"cancelled,\" \"weather,\" and \"bad.\" These words are significant because they convey the core meaning and context of the sentence.\n\n1. \"Cancelled\": This word signifies that the event (the match) was not held or took place. It is essential to understanding the outcome of the situation and why it occurred.\n\n2. \"Weather\": This word refers to the atmospheric conditions. It is crucial to understanding the reason behind the cancellation of the match. The weather was the primary factor that led to the cancellation.\n\n3. \"Bad\": This word describes the severity of the weather. It helps to determine the level of impact the weather had on the match and why it was deemed too bad to proceed.\n\nIn summary, the most important words in the sentence are \"cancelled,\" \"weather,\" and \"bad.\" These words together convey the primary meaning of the sentence, which is that the match was not held due to the poor weather conditions.\n\nWhat are the most important words in the following sentence:\n\na wren and a robin perched on a branch\n\nIn the sentence \"a wren and a robin perched on a branch,\" the most important words are \"wren,\" \"robin,\" \"perched,\" and \"branch.\" These words are crucial in understanding the core meaning and imagery of the sentence. Here's a breakdown of their significance:\n\n1. \"Wren\" and \"robin\" - These words are the main subjects of the sentence. They are two specific types of birds mentioned. The sentence is describing a scene with these two birds, so these words are essential in understanding the focal point of the sentence.\n\n2. \"Perched\" - This word describes the action or state of the birds. It tells us how the birds are positioned on the branch. Without this word, the sentence would lack the essential information about the birds' location and their relationship to the branch.\n\n3. \"Branch\" - This word is the object on which the birds are perched. It is crucial for understanding the physical setting and the connection between the birds and their surroundings. It also helps to create a mental image of the scene in the reader's mind.\n\nIn summary, the most important words in the sentence \"a wren and a robin perched on a branch\" are \"wren,\" \"robin,\" \"perched,\" and \"branch.\" These words provide the essential information about the subjects, their action, and their environment, allowing the reader to visualize the scene accurately.\n\nWhat are the most important words in the following sentence:\n\ngrass on the soccer field\n\nIn the given sentence \"grass on the soccer field,\" the most important words are \"grass\" and \"soccer field.\" These two words are crucial for understanding the primary subject and context of the sentence.\n\n1. \"Grass\": This word is essential in the sentence as it represents the primary object being described. Grass is a common element found on a soccer field, and its presence is important for the game to take place. Without the word \"grass,\" the sentence would lose its meaning and significance.\n\n2. \"Soccer field\": This phrase provides context and location for the grass. It is important to note that the sentence is referring to grass specifically on a soccer field, which is a sports field where soccer games are played. The word \"soccer\" gives the sentence a sporting context, while \"field\" provides the broader concept of an",

With 400 taels a year for two years, that's 800 taels. That's enough to buy more rooms in a rented house and add more thin sandy land. Even if there's extra money, they've been working hard for a year, so let's leave them some to make up for it. Even though we're trying to save money, we can't be too stingy. If we try to save another 200 to 300 taels, it would look too harsh. So what I'm saying is that the accountants outside will only take out 400 to 500 taels a year, and that's not too harsh. They will get some small benefits, and the older ladies in the garden will be better off. The flowers and trees will grow better and better every year. And you will get something extra. This way, we don't lose our big picture. If we just focus on saving, we can't find out where the extra money comes from. If we take some extra money from everyone, the people in and outside the house will be very upset. It's not good for a family like ours. We have about 50 older ladies in the garden. If we only give them this, the rest will complain that it's not fair. That's why I said before: they should only have this little extra, and it's not too much.\"From the beginning of the year to the end of the year, he gives each person, whether it is left or right, a certain number of money, and everyone contributes and distributes it to these gardeners. Although they do not manage these things, they take care of the garden day and night. When the servants are on duty, they close the doors and windows, get up early and go to bed late, and take care of the ladies when it rains or snows, carry the sedan chairs, row the boats, and pull the ice beds, all of which are their duties. In a year, they work hard in the garden all the way, and if the garden is successful, they should share some of it. - There is also a very small matter that needs to be said: when you only take care of your own wealth and do not give them some, they may not be openly resentful, but they are not satisfied. They use \"false public self-interest\" to take a few more fruits and flowers, and you have nowhere to complain. They also earn some interest, and when you don't pay attention, they will take care of you.",

Moxue said, \"That's why Grandma often tells us: 'Don't have too many mirrors in small rooms. Children's souls aren't fully formed, and if they have too many mirrors, they'll be scared at night and have bad dreams. Now, there's a bed in front of the big mirror. Sometimes, if you put the curtain around it, it's fine. But when it's hot and you're tired, who's going to think to put it away? For example, if you forget, you'll lie down and play with your reflection. As soon as you close your eyes, you'll have crazy dreams. And why did you wake up calling your own name? It's best to move the bed in tomorrow.\" Just then, someone came to call for Jin Yue.",
