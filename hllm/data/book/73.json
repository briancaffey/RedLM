What will she say now?\" A sense of uneasiness seized his heart, his legs and arms felt weak, and he felt extremely depressed. He thought that it was best to read a book first. Tomorrow, Father Jia would have an oral test of him. If he could read the book familiarly, he could easily answer questions even if he was busy with other things. He made up his mind, and hurried to put on his clothes and start reading. He then felt sorry, \"I have not read any books for a long time. I seem to have forgotten. If I had read them daily, I would have remembered. Now, I only remember two books, the 'Da Xue', 'Zhong Yong' and 'Meng Zi'. I can recall half of the 'Meng Zi' and the rest of the book has been forgotten. As for the 'Five Classics', they have been used for writing poems and compiling essays and I am only slightly familiar with them. As for the other books, I have not read them often and I don't mind forgetting them. As for prose, there are only a few works of 'Zuo Zhuan', 'Guo Ce', 'Gong Yang', 'Gu Li', etc. I did not read them for several years, and I only read them occasionally. I cannot remember them even if I want to. Another difficulty is that I hate the formal style of essay. I think this is not a way to show the wisdom of sages and scholars, but a way to seek fame and wealth. Father Jia has asked me to read hundreds of books and they are all formal styles of essay written by other people. Once in a while, some of the essays are somewhat beautiful. But Father Jia does not ask me to read them carefully, he just wants to see if I have a sense of beauty. Now, if I study one of them, Father Jia will ask about another. I don't know which one to study now. I can't study them all tonight. I feel frustrated. I only want to read, but I am worried about the others. The maidservants of this room are very tired but are still waiting for me to finish.\" By this time, Xisi and her friends had lit the candles and were ready to serve him tea. The other maidservants were very tired, and some were trying to rest a little. \"Bitch!\" Nqing complained, \"What the hell are you all doing?

Coincidentally, Baoshai, Laodai, Baotian, and Zhangtong, who were also concerned about Yingchun's discomfort, decided to come over to comfort her. When they arrived in the courtyard, they heard someone talking inside.探春 peeked through the gauze window and saw Yingchun leaning against the bed, engrossed in a book, as though she hadn't heard them.探春 chuckled. The maids hurriedly opened the curtain and announced, \"The ladies have arrived.\" Yingchun put down the book in her hands and got up. The old woman stopped talking on seeing someone come in, especially with Zhangtong there, and excused herself to leave.探春 sat down and asked, \"Who was talking just now? It sounded like a fight.\" Yingchun smiled, \"There's nothing much to it, just that they're making a mountain out of a molehill. Why bother asking?\"探春 smiled, \"I just heard 'Golden Phoenix', and 'only we servants should be asking for money'. Who is asking a servant for money? Could it be that Sister Ying is asking a servant for money?\" Siqi and Xiuju replied, \"You're right, Miss. How could Sister Ying ask for anything from them?\"探春 smiled, \"If Sister Ying isn't asking, then it must be us asking? Call him in, I want to ask him.\" Yingchun smiled, \"That is indeed very funny. You weren't involved, why bother?\"探春 said, \"That's not always the case. I'm just like Sister Ying. Her matters are also mine. If he says something about Sister Ying, he's saying something about me. If someone grumbles at me, Sister Ying hears it and it's as if she's the one being scolded. As owners, we naturally wouldn't manage such trivial matters of money, just using what we need when we need it. But I wonder why the 'Worn-out Silk Phoenix' is also in the mix?\"",
