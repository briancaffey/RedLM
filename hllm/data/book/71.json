Xing had already been vexed with the Old Lady for two days when the Nan’an Imperial Lady had come to visit. The Old Lady had allowed only T’an-chun to go out and see her, and Xing’s spite had been growing ever since. Now she heard yet more malicious gossip about Feng from the little courtier who had been crowing about her in her ear. Xing had never liked Feng, and the more she heard the more she disliked her. The next day, she went to the Old Lady’s quarters to greet her, and the clansmen were there too, and the Old Lady was delighted. She had the male members of her extended family come forward to pay their respects. The Old Lady was leaning back in a special large chair, with the girls of the family—Tsao Ch’ao, Tsao Ch’ên, Ts’ao Yi, Hsüan, T’an-chun, Ts’ai-ch’un, and others—forming a ring around her. Hsüan’s mother had brought with her a daughter, Huili, and Ts’ao Ch’ing’s mother had brought a daughter, Ssu-erh, and several other granddaughters, amounting to twenty-one or so. The Old Lady was delighted with Huili and Ssu-erh’s looks, and felt they were unusual, so she had them sit in front of her. Wang Yu was massaging the Old Lady’s legs on the floor. Mama Xing had been sitting in the topmost seat, and the order of precedence below her had been arranged according to rank. The ladies went first, and then the gentlemen. The Old Lady was propped up in bed, and said, \"Never mind.\" Lai Ta, together with all the servants, had come from the courtyard gates down to the Great Hall, where they knelt and磕头 knelt and磕头 (literally, prostrated themselves). The ceremonies were over, and they knelt and磕头 knelt and磕头 again, then it was the maids’ turn, and they wasted two meals’ time in this. Next came the ritual of releasing the birds, and Xing and the others burned the paper, then the performance of the opera and drinking of wine began. After intermission, the Old Lady came into her quarters to rest, and ordered Huili and Ssu-erh to stay for two days before sending them home. Xing came in with Feng, and Feng and she both bore a grudge for having been taken care of by her. They wanted to play in the garden, so they stayed in the Old Lady’s quarters for the night. Xing came in only at the end of the festivities, and, with a smile, begged Feng to let the two girls go. She said that she had heard that Feng had lashed out at two servants last night, but that it was not proper to plead for them. But the Old Lady’s birthday was in progress, and the family was giving away money and rice to the poor, so she could not stand the idea of injuring the servants. If she were not taking into account their looks, she would consider the Old Lady’s face. She would let them go for the moment. Finished speaking, she got into her carriage and left.",

But we don't have that kind of luck, so we should just be wild and disorderly. \" Youshi said, \"Who is as carefree and care not for anything as you? You just play with the ladies and eat when you're hungry, sleep when you're tired. In a few years, you'll be the same, and you don't even think about what comes after. \" Bao Yu laughed and said, \"I just want to spend each day at a time, and when I die, that's it. What can I worry about after that!\" Li Wan and Youshi both laughed and said, \"That's nonsense! Even if you're not a man of ability, you'll end up old here, but what about the Third Sister and the rest of the ladies? Will they not marry?\" Youshi said, \"No wonder people say you're not able. You're really a silly thing!\" Bao Yu laughed and said, \"Everyone's nature is hard to determine, who lives and who dies, who knows? I might die tomorrow, and then I'll be satisfied for the rest of my life.\" Everyone said, \"You've really gone off the deep end. It's better not to talk to him. If you talk to him, he'll either say something ridiculous or something crazy.\" Xiluan laughed and said, \"My brother, don't say such things. When all the sisters here are married off, even Grandma and Mother will be lonely. I'll come and keep you company.\" Li Wan and Youshi both laughed and said, \"You can't say something like that. Are you not going to marry either?\" The sentence left Xiluan feeling a little embarrassed, and she lowered her head. It was already midnight, and everyone went to their rooms to rest. No one mentioned it again.",

By this time, no one else was in the garden; only the watchhouse had its lights burning. The moonlight was faint, with half of it hanging in the sky. With no lantern in her possession, and her steps light, Du Yan did not disturb the others. She needed to relieve herself, so she found a patch of grass and made her way towards it. She turned behind a large rock, beneath a towering tree. Just as she reached the edge of the rock, she heard rustling of clothing, her heart pounding with fear. Upon closer inspection, she saw two people there, who promptly tried to hide behind the trees and rocks when they noticed her. Du Yan had keen eyesight, and with the dim moonlight, she had already spotted a tall, red-dressed girl with messy hair, none other than Si Qi from Yang Chun's quarters. Assuming she was playing a game of hide-and-seek like the other girls, Du Yan called out with a smile, \"Si Qi! If you don't come out quickly, I'll shout and catch you as a thief. It's quite surprising to see a girl this big still playing games without getting tired.\"",
