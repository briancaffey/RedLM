            "english": "Explanation:\nIn this passage, the speaker, likely a male (since the name \"宝玉\" implies a Chinese male figure), is addressing someone else (referred to as \"姑娘\") who seems to be a female, in a somewhat emotional and reflective tone. The speaker recounts past instances where the two were close, suggesting that there was a time when they enjoyed spending time together, sharing things, and being in each other's company. The speaker then contrasts this past intimacy with a current feeling of neglect and misunderstanding, where the other person, supposedly the \"姑娘,\" seems to value other individuals (like \"宝姐姐\" and \"凤姐姐\") more than the speaker. The speaker expresses feelings of betrayal, confusion, and a sense of being misunderstood, leading to frustration and tears. The name \"宝玉\" used here is a metaphorical reference to a valuable gem or treasure, often associated with the character Jia Baoyu from the Chinese novel \"Dream of the Red Chamber\". The passage thus seems to be a reflection of complex interpersonal dynamics, possibly inspired by the relationships depicted in the novel. The translation endeavors to capture this emotional depth and the specific literary context, including the use of metaphors and implied references to literary works.",
