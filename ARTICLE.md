RedLLM is a novel way to study literature and art. It is developed specifically for students reading one of China’s most famous literary works: Dream of the Red Chamber. It uses leading large language models and vision language models from Chinese AI labs including Alibaba’s Qwen team, Baichuan Intelligent Technology and 01.AI. RedLLM uses tools, techniques and services from NVIDIA and LlamaIndex including NVIDIA NIMs, Retrieval Augmented Generation and Multi-Modal RAG with vision language models. This project was built for the NVIDIA and LlamaIndex Developer Contest.
